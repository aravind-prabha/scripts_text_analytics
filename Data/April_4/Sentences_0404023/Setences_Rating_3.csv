International Airport,Most of the restaurants are closed or they close earlier than advertised.,3
International Airport,"Continuous, annoying light chop. I said hello to a pilot as I was walking down the terminal to my gate. He looked at me then brazenly looked away as if to disregard my existence as an interior being while stabbing ice daggers through my brittle heart. Thought this was maybe just a fluke incident but it happens to me every time I pass through this airport...EVERY TIME.",3
Airport,It's not very busy as of Monday 12/7/20. I was told to allow 90minute before departure of flight.,3
International Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,3
Airport,Very huge airport let's just say during the day the staff are much more able to assist and support you as you make your way through the terminals but at night due to COVID help and insight is very limited in which in other words you're on your own.,3
Airport,It was fast getting  in and out had to pick up my grandson.,3
International Airport,Signs for getting around are a bit hard to follow. The 'Blue Line' was long getting to us. Bag return were by far the speediest I've ever seen in my travels.,3

International Airport,It's quite busy this lovely Friday evening,3
Airport,Airport is great unless your flying in with bags. I‚Äôve waited over 30 min on both occasions and on one occasion they just didn‚Äôt label the carrousel,3
International Airport,The airport was not as busy as I thought it would have been,3
International Airport,There are a lot of shops and restaurants still closed in some terminals.  This airport is pretty busy but it is a few days before Christmas.,3

International Airport,First time  on the Train. Had to connect  to my flight.,3
International Airport,Its Atlanta. Study the map before you get here,3
International Airport,"Once again, had 20 minute run to my connecting gate.",3
International Airport,On the 9th of December 23rd we flew into Atlanta took the train to the main terminal and the temperature in the train cars were 87.6 degrees. It was suffocatingly hot. That is kind of a safety issue if people overheat and start passing out on the train passenger cars.,3
International Airport,"Busy, busy. Social distancing is hard, but travellers are making extra effort.",3

International Airport,The delta terminal where my flight is has a very low number of seats in the lobby. Room for 4 ppl is all. Everything else is great.,3
International Airport,"Very busy
Should be atleaat 2 hours early",3
Airport,"mediocre at best.  I have been in alot of airports, this one does not stand out for anything really.  the food options are weak, but has good seating area's.  Not big enough for airline lounges.  restrooms are clean.  Giant rabbit hanging is odd at best.",3
International Airport,Had to wait 9 hours in an airport which only had a bar and one restaurant open. Luckily I had a few videos in my tablet. This Corona Virus makes life really lonely.,3
International Airport,"Delta Sky club was nice,not very crowded at all. Club ATL was crowded not as nice but still better than waiting in those hard airport chairs",3
International Airport,So there's no restaurant food at all on the side terminals and there is no sign for that,3
Airport,This airport is extremely busy.  Wish there was a better way to manage the traffic,3
Airport,Nicely renovated but nothing open,3
International Airport,"Airport was surprisingly busy, but it is three days before New Year's.",3
International Airport,As large as this airport is the people should be better trained and know where things are I don't think I've ever asked anyone in Atlanta airport where something was and got a straight answer. Training training training,3
International Airport,A lot of construction still going on.,3
International Airport,"Nice airport , but staff were not helpful. You could tell they hated their job. Some were helpful many were not.",3

International Airport,This place can be a zoo and total cluster fluck if you are connecting and have a narrow time frame to depart from another terminal. Edit: smooth sailing on most recent connection domestic to intl.,3
International Airport,You can't rent as a local with no flight without a credit card but they'll let you book with a debit card online ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,3
International Airport,It's to big of a airport . From experience if you are connecting flights make Shure u get a lot of time,3
International Airport,I needed food but received none,3
International Airport,Not super crowded and a lot of sanitation stations,3
International Airport,In one of the smaller lounges - no drop in quality of services offered.,3
International Airport,"Always busy but i figured maybe TSA would have that place running more smoothly & efficiently I guess not. Now I remember why I disliked this airport, security checkpoint at most times is a joke. Definitely get there 2hrs ahead of time unless you have pre-check.",3
International Airport,"First time I experienced a train taking me to my embarking course, it could use improvement regarding the food vendors, but the staff its great. TSA its a little more annoying and rude than in other airports though.",3
International Airport,Most of the shops are still closed probably due to covid,3
International Airport,Busy but not crowded at 5:30 am,3
International Airport,All that's open here for food now is Starbucks and a convince store... Get food before coming to Terminal F..,3
International Airport,Its a really nice airport but I thought with the high price renovations they would have accounted for the pick/up and drop/off traffic!!! But no satisfaction.,3
International Airport,Its clean and friendly. They just need to update so there are places to charge your phone. Very much lacking this service if you are on a layover.,3
Airport,"We  are excited to share that Sacramento International Airport now offers onsite COIVD-19 testing

International Airport,I wanted one of these from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Papi's Cuban Grill but didn't get it. Dang.,3

International Airport,Great airport just had bad experience with delta taking Mr from one end to the other multiple times because they kept changing gates on me almost making me miss my flight,3
International Airport,"I wish I had taken more flights on Mad Dogs, like this Delta Air Lines MD-88 departing Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport back in the day",3
International Airport,"Out of all the airports I've been to, this one is consistently staffed with the rudest,  most unhelpful staff anywhere.  Doesn't matter what airline you pick.  The airport itself is great and modern and easily traversed.   Pick up the entire airport, give it a good shake to get all these duds out of it,  and set it in another city, and it would be 5 stars",3
International Airport,"Still a busy airport, not as crowded as it used to be.",3
International Airport,The parking lots were confusing but at least there were workers and wheel chairs.,3
International Airport,Spending the night in Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport üòíüòí A Covid case shut down the ATL traffic control tower and severely delayed flights out of Orlando today.,3
Airport,"It's called SMF...But, shouldn't it be called SIA?!?... Anyways, nice mid-sized airport!  I wish they had Massage Envy and/or a hair salon/barber shop here.  No duty-free shopping here.  No Panda Express or Chinese food here.  No Chando's Tacos, or Jimboy's Tacos, or even a breakfast diner.  No light rail train to downtown Sac...I appreciate the cleanliness, safety, and friendliness though.",3
International Airport,"Can't outrun the plane train, but you sure can try",3
International Airport,Easy to navigate and everything on time but customs line was extremely long and far too crowded for the age of covid.,3
International Airport,Typical Hartsfield experience.  Landed in area A and have to train your layover to area E. But that's what is to be expected when you land in Delta's main southeastern hub,3
International Airport,"So in the D Concourse, I saw the Five Guys sign and got excited when I thought I could get a handmade shake, burger and fries.  Shakes are not an option in this concourse and more importantly, the burgers are only 1 patty instead of the two you typically get at any Five Guys and it is about $3 more. Just buyer beware. 1/22/21@2:30 pm.",3
International Airport,"This airport was big af. Way too many passengers to only have 2 ppl doing the North security checkpoint tho. I did get confused when it was time to return the rental. Overall, it was a decent experience.",3
Airport,"This airport is old and the flights are more regional than anything else. All flights from this location go to Dallas or Houston for connectors. Dallas is where flying dreams die, only and average airport until the city stops playing politics with the amenities inside the airport and invests in the city's airport.",3
International Airport,"The Airport is very nice, well kept and well organized. The only negative is out front, it is uncomfortable since there are needy people wandering around asking for money, plus the only place to sit is the smoking area. As long as your in and out then picked up quickly it fine but if you have to wait for your ride to arrive its not a good experience.",3
International Airport,Big airport .  extra time needed to get to gates..,3
Airport,"On time, not impressive in the way of food, esp prices.",3

Airport,There were not a lot of people.,3
Airport,"This airport is small and easy to navigate. But I will never understand why every time I come to this airport, it takes them forever to begin to boarding process. Every single time I‚Äôm here.",3
International Airport,I spent my time in the Sky Club having a latte,3
International Airport,Fine I guess? I had a six hour delayed flight. I felt like the available options for dining and coffee were kind of lame but the TSA line moved fast. I noticed there weren't many places for people to plug in their devices and that's maybe the worst thing.,3
Airport,Boss Bagels is now at the San Antonio International Airport!,3

International Airport,Very big airport. A lot of walking involved if you have to stop at baggage claims and rent a car.,3
Airport,Very crowded on Friday night.   There's massive construction at the southern terminal again and traffic is backing up.   Plan for at least an extra 30 minutes.,3
Airport,"Not a bad airport as it's my main hub.  Food is consistently lacking  and less than mediocre though.
Tastes like the restaurants get the food from the same supplier.",3
Airport,"Airport was ok, TSA decided to use my carry-on as a training tool and kept running it through the scanner because the lady didn't know what she was looking at.",3
Airport,"Busy location..clean. Great service !

Airport,Busiest airport in the world....,3
Airport,"This is not my favorite airport, but far from the worst. It suffers because of how busy it is. However, this time it was not crowded at all.  Update. Still busy, crowded, and dated.",3
Airport,Smaller airport slightly convenient to catch a flight from here. Might hit some traffic on i5 by downtown or close to the airport for construction. Somewhat pricey food options. But like terminal B. aka the newer terminal. Now days started getting packed maybe because of the holiday.,3
Airport,Airport is very busy and tsa checkpoints do move fast at all.,3
Airport,"I flew United, staff was great. TSA was a joke! Told them I had hearing loss and they did nothing to help not speak up, not get closer, not try to make it easier for me to understand what the heck they were saying causing me to hold up the line.",3
Airport,Busy busy airport. A lot of construction going on. The concourse was not working properly. Very long walk to long term parking. Fair experience,3

Airport,We got there on time and my family wait time wasn't long at all. Thank God,3

Airport,"This airport is well organized and maintained, but the scarcity of open food is ridiculous. Despite the fact that there were flights going out of nearly every gate in C, all but 2 restaurants were closed. As a result, the places that were open had lines so long, you‚Äôd need a 2 hour layover to get a meal.",3
Airport,Still haven't  decided yet...pretty  bizzy here,3
Airport,"This airport was pretty good going out and coming back in. One problem was one of the elevators were down going to baggage claim, and the parking was full pretty much when we arrived so we had to walk far.",3
Airport,Terrible lines even off peak. Why in the world can't they build another airport or 2 in metro ATL like other major metropolitan areas???,3
International Airport,Making the connection to DC via Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport today...,3
Airport,"It was clean, but I was disappointed that they have taken out all the seats. Its difficult for elderly people who are waiting to pick up someone. I understand about being safe with regards to covid,  but couldn't the chairs be placed 6ft apart? Just a thought....",3
Airport,My only issue is why are they giving out snacks on the plane so people can take their mask down to eat?!,3

Airport,"Long lines, please be patient and smile under your mask!",3
Airport,Things in the C concourse close down too early. Lots of flights leave after 7,3
Airport,"I like the Airport, the facilities. However, this Airport needs to improve in Customer service.",3
Airport,"Extremely crowded. Lines move as quick as possible.  Very confusing because of the volume. Allow plenty of time ...  like 1.5 - 2 hours for domestic travel
But I really did enjoy watching the security dogs sniff us out as we walked 2x2 through the security checkpoint. I love a well-trained working dog who's handler is sensible and even-tempered.",3
Airport,It was a big place didn't stay there long,3
Airport,Airport is great. Parking is not. Parking seems way to high and expensive.,3
Airport,Super huge!!!! Pick up is very congested!!!! Please get there at least 2 hours ahead of time before take off... Overall just roll with it!!!,3
Airport,The bathrooms smelled really bad. Everything else was good.,3
Airport,To busy this morning but check fast,3
Airport,This airport is always busy. It's well-lit and clean. Fairly easy to get around being such a large airport. If you're not familiar with the airport as we weren't it can be somewhat daunting.,3
Airport,There should be earlier accomodations for those that catch early flights. The restaurants don't open until 7. The vending machines gave us a hard time accepting our bills.,3
Airport,It was packed but tsa did an excellent job getting everyone in line and checked.,3
Airport,A zoo as always. Even during COVID.,3
Airport,Good signage to show directions....... rental car companies extremely slow.......oneperson at counter at 7PM.....ridiculous!!!!,3

Airport,Security was surprising fast but the prices were still insane. üòÇ,3
International Airport,And we headed to the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport!,3
Airport,Nice airport  but the set up to get to the plane and off is very confusing,3

Airport,It's super busy at check-in point this morning but I'm assuming it's because it's a Saturday morning,3

Airport,a bit confusing with the uber and Lyft signs for a new person in Atlanta airport,3
International Airport,It was so hot in there after coming off our flight from Charleston SC.  Then walking through there was even hotter especially for a handicapped person,3
International Airport,Arrived in Atlanta at 730am from a 6am flight. Nothing was open to get breakfast from where my next terminal was located. There was a soda machine that had a note taped to it that the soda was warm and a vending machine that was just about empty. Not cool when you're hungry and about to board another 2.5 hour flight.,3
Airport,"At this time it could use a good breeze as wearing masks in a stuffy place is less than fun, it can feel good and sticky. Was a tad confusing finding where the security line was as the signs were sparse and easy muddled by 5 or more other temporary signs all somewhat telling you where to go. Once in, it's your average big airport nothing much to say.",3
Airport,"With COVID, it's lacking on restaurant availability.  Otherwise it's business as usual.  Can't wait for masks to not be a thing.",3

International Airport,"The airport itself is amazing. Restaurants, art, shopping, the staff however is not accommodating, I get they probably get all sorts of vexing customers as well as incidents but it's their job to assist u and answer ur questions. If the staff had been better my review would have been 5 Stars!",3
International Airport,"Clean and unhurried, not too many options to eat",3
International Airport,There is very little food available as most places are closed. Every place that was open for sit down dining had a long wait and many had a limited menu. The dining options do not seem to be keeping pace with the increasing number of travellers.  The airport itself is very clean and all of the employees of the airport and the vendors are doing a great job.,3
International Airport,Dropping off my son. It was really busy at 5:30 am. Parking area ok but its sad that u can't walk thru with ur guest to where they check in board the plane. Didn't walk around to see if anything was open. It's a sad lonely place now.üò¢üò¢üò¢,3

International Airport,My incoming flight landed and I only had 15 minutes to get there. I missed my flight. They gave me another ticket for later flight. This is a huge airport and should transport people if they are pushing that close.,3

International Airport,Very easy to maneuver through. Alot of renovations going on but it didn't seem to interfere with getting from point a to boarding.,3
International Airport,Staff was great...even security! The lines for the security check were long but only took about 45 minutes to get through. The problem is the place is pretty dirty. I didn't couldn't wait to get my shoes back on after going through security. It was especially dirty around and under the benches you can sit on to put your shoes back on.,3
International Airport,"The airport was really easy to navigate on the way in. Going out, though, was tough. To me, it was not clear enough how to get to the security line. Also, it took a really long time to get through it. C'est la vie, I guess, for a busy airport.",3
International Airport,"This airport does a marvelous job of handling a huge flow of passengers.
That's until you go out to get picked up by a family member in a car. What a mess! You have to trot across several lines of traffic and then hold up the flow while you get in the car. Someone needs to figure out a better way.",3

International Airport,"Good airport. TSA is curt and unfriendly most of the time. Boarding is terribly inefficient during Corona. The food is expensive and mediocre, as is to be expected, and I would not have it any other way. It has a very aiport-y feel.",3
International Airport,My least favorite airport in the world,3
Airport,Was picked up. Didn't need parking.,3
International Airport,"A little confusing with trying to.find where the lyft/users would be located. However,  it was fine. The women's bathroom was PACKED. May want to review data of bathroom usage to help make it less congested for washing hands and dealing with many people in one central location. Yet, it was decently clean. A person was in there trying to clean up.",3
Airport,It's a small airport but it's okay for a short lay over on a transfer. There should be more options to eat for the prices you got to pay.,3
International Airport,"Only because when you arrive at 528 am, and have to wait 2 hours for your connection flight Way on the other side of the airport, theres nothing open..",3
International Airport,Waiting on flight even with 45 minutes to go through security still had plenty of time to get to gate.,3
International Airport,"The last warmer than normal high temperature at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was June 18. Monday could be a bit warmer than normal, but most of the next 1-2 weeks looks relatively cool. Not exactly cold, with temps in the mid to upper 80s, but no extreme heat is likely in north Georgia into mid-July.",3
International Airport,"Great they are very strict that's why they got a 4 out of 5. I understand why, but go bother people who fit the description. On that note. Do exactly what you are told while going thru security or you will have to go thru again.",3
Airport,"Clean and small International airport. It should be international ""light"" because I think the only direct flight out of the country is to Mexico.",3
International Airport,"It's a nice airport, using it as a backdrop for political means, and Black empowerment is at best misguided, while also spreading lies",3
International Airport,"Always a bit chaotic,  but large airports often are.  Traveled on July 4th and many of the shops were closed. I was surprised at how much garbage was left out by people.  It made finding a clean seat at my gate challenging.",3
International Airport,Traveling on July 5th.  Airline instructed us to be at the airports 3 hours early.  Two restaurants open with incredibly long lines.  I guess the airport didn‚Äôt realize it would be busy. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,3

Airport,Ticketing and security lines are a HUGE mess.  Arrive at least 3 hours before your flight as a precaution.  There are a lot of rude passengers as well.,3
International Airport,Can be more streamlined in managing their check-in lines. Airlines specific check-in is something that most airports have.,3
Airport,"Looks nice, but Needs better maps/directories for newcomers. Had a hard time finding where to go from terminal to rental car area. Also a free Shout-out to Hertz here for keeping it consistently slow.",3

Airport,This terminal REALLY needs a Cell Phone Lot!,3
International Airport,One person at TSA precheck and only one luggage scanner operating causing a large wait and lots of people in line. Other than that I really like the Atlanta Airport.,3

International Airport,"Beautiful Airport but traffic in and out of here and to the airport, awful, always in adventure in Atlanta.",3
International Airport,"COVID-19 has been buried in Jackson's tomb in Atlanta. All the restaurants, bars and grumpy wait staff are back. No one follows queues or row numbers when boarding, because traffic laws also apply to boarding in the ATL. If you're nimble, walking is faster than the train. The food selection remains the gem of the southeast.",3
International Airport,Not as costly as some clubs especially on the daily entry fee.  Crowded and food is not very good.  Drinks are free.  Oops time to catch my next flight.,3
International Airport,"Had ok experience. As I walked up to security; which had an extremely long line, a TSA agent walked up and said for a shorter line follow him. Probably saved me 30-45 mins. Lucky mostly.
Second flight out of ATL this year and another delay.
Would be nice to leave ATL on time for once.",3
International Airport,Busy! Back to pre- pandemic volume for sure .,3
International Airport,"I normally love this airport. If I have a lay over ATL is the best place for a lay over. However, closing your restaurants at 9 pm is just wrong.",3

Airport,Short lines at the airline and through security.  Always fly out of Sac if I can,3
International Airport,Post COVID-19 travel is no different than before other than the masks being mandated.,3

International Airport,"GREAT! However, American airline was very bad. Never again if i can help it.",3
International Airport,This is a busy airport expect traffic and people delays.  It will be a stressful experience and staff is distracted.  It is best to know where you are going and have a plan.,3
International Airport,There was only 2 agents on duty for 100s of passengers. which caused us to stand in line too long.Employees were friendly but the airport signage use some improvements.,3
International Airport,Only let down is so many shops closed.,3
International Airport,"Always a great facility but was very disappointed all restaurants were closed except BWW and McDonalds. Only place for any food after 8pm besides these two options were snack vendors. I understand the COVID era, but the busiest airport in the world and very limited food options is not a good combination.",3
International Airport,"when you travel a lot, Hartsfield is inevitable.      Probably my least favorite U.S. airport.    Always crammed.",3
Airport,I wish the restaurant and coffee shops would open at the same time as the rest of the airport. Besides that everything was good.,3
Airport,Take your time there is a lot of walking required.,3

International Airport,Crazy busy but what would u expect from an international airport.. .,3
International Airport,"Hartsfirld being the busiest airport in US and the world, manage your time to come atleast an hour or two hours before your departure. The line to security check point started under the big dome.",3
International Airport,"As a facility it's a very accommodating international airport as for anything being open or anywhere to eat any kitchens open to serve food, you could get a beer here and there, vending machines were bare, but other than that their ability to house aircrafts and get people on them...not bad. I also it isn't their fault I guess the moral or the story is to bring snacks.",3
International Airport,Get there early (2+ hours early) and you'll be fine.,3
International Airport,It was very crowded as expected. Not great food choices in concourse A,3
International Airport,I fly at least once a month and passenger demand is back in effect. My flight was packed and every seat was taken.,3

International Airport,"Make sure you eat before you get a connecting flight here. All the restaurants close early. We had one choice of food to eat because everything was closed by 8pm. The line was so long that we didn't have tome to wait and decided to grab something from the vending machines, but they don't work and would not take our card or dollar bills.",3
International Airport,The arrival wasn't great because of chaos to the car rental folks.bad customer service experience departure wasn't great either crowded approach to be let off and not into the job.But the specialty assistants are the anchor very professional and patience for the janky fliers,3
International Airport,It's a big airport the first time l ger lost,3
International Airport,"I really want to give this airport 5 star because I feel as far as air travel it's the most organized airport in the world. But currently aftermath of Covid its very boring, hardly anything open, everywhere are long lines. Just sad. So many people come through this place and so little to offer to them. Atlanta, wake up!",3
International Airport,Airport is to big to be haven those 2 hour tsa check lines,3
International Airport,Some of the staff were very rude when  asking for help,3

International Airport,For the most part it's decent but it's packed and the air conditioner seems to be on low LOL but I had a good time out here,3
International Airport,"A big Airport overwhelmingly huge, you have to keep asking where and what to do, because signs arent enough or lines are too big that you don't know for what it is.",3
International Airport,The hotel was ok but the beds were very uncomfortable. They were very hard. The staff was pleasant.,3
International Airport,Economy Park is to the max. Nearly 21 min to find a empty parking spot after a person that landed showing me there spot. Airport needs to expand or advise when less than 10 spots available.  As to find any is a issues with a hand full of cars looking for parking already.,3
International Airport,Very big international Airport it took an hour for me to retrieve my luggage,3
International Airport,"American Airlines baggage claim was at a different location from the other Airlines.The signage to locate their baggage claim area was poor. American Airlines only gave it's customers the carousel number, no instructions was provided on finding their baggage claim area. There were no airport personal in the North baggage claim area to assist with navigating to the correct area.",3
International Airport,"Always busy, but they get you in fast.",3
International Airport,Long walk and arrival and departure gates from B to E. Very crowded. Can't hear or understand accents of gate agents as they mumble. People lax about wearing masks properly. Gates need more cleaning. And of course a departure delay due to thunderstorms.,3

Airport,"On again, off again mask restrictions. Poor signage in regards to parking directions. Big plus! No Homeless!!!",3
International Airport,Big and crowded. It was a challenge to get from one concourse to another in time to make my connection.,3
International Airport,Always an experience with this airport.  It is very large so when the service train isn't working it takes 25 minutes just to get to the baggage claim.  And that is if you are speedwalking and using the moving walkways.   Other than that it was OK.   There were also detours but they did have people directing us where to go.,3
International Airport,That airport's very big... so try to be there early. The line was no joke for me.  Ask specific questions if not sure where to go to avoid wasting time.,3
International Airport,"Not a very pleasant experience with Luftansa about COVID-19 test. All the same, my trip was successful.",3
International Airport,Parking was full but the check-in was smooth sailing. Airport was hot,3

Airport,"The AIRPORT was great! I got thru VERY Looping lines in an astonishingly short time!
Heads up to Pete's Coffee for not being open at 5am: You're losing tons of money!! Starbucks made a KILLING this morning!",3
International Airport,Need more directions to where you need to go inside airport,3
Airport,Easy check in. Drop off. Truly lacks decent food offering in the old terminal especially early morning departures. Pick up for arrivals can sometimes be annoying as the self righteous stop in the middle lanes blocking others. Sherriff's / transportation jockey should do better..,3
International Airport,"you need to have really be prepared to use your entire 2 hours if you are checking a bag . there are a lot of places to eat at this airport but things in the north thermal closed at 7 local time the only thing open is Friday‚Äôs . also in north terminal you still have to remove everything‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ not sure about the other terminals

International Airport,Food vendors shut down too early.  Some staff have bad attitudes and are not customer friendly.  They should be weeded out and told to either improve their social skills or leave.,3
Airport,"Offsite rental car parking. That‚Äôs a negative because it adds time to your trip.  Starbucks has a huge line, 20 + people, because nothing else is open.  Otherwise it‚Äôs a normal airport.",3

International Airport,"Great airport, just way over crowded",3
Airport,Ridesharing was difficult for a first time user. Hint: follow the signs. Lol!,3
International Airport,Crowded as usual but it's an airport.   Delta changed gates on us.  Just happened to notice it on the sign.   An announcement would have been nice.,3
International Airport,"Nice airport with many dining options.  TSA was horribly rude and couldn't put a smile on their face to save a soul.  Also, perhaps it was because we were at the non-Delta gates, but there were no power sources that worked and most Scopus r and eateries were shut down at 330 in the afternoon.",3
International Airport,"I guess I should have prepared myself for the airport coming in, with the train and the baggage claim, but going back was a different story.

International Airport,"75% of the shops/food places were closed. Power plugs are not very abundant. Some airlines have a lot at thier gates, but not all airlines have some. I think the airport should do something about it and not leave it up to the airlines.",3
International Airport,Went thru at 6pm Monday. Almost all shops and restaurants were closed. Saw many employees without masks.  Womens Bathroom i went in was totally out of TP. Electronic signs rotate so if you're not looking at the right moment you'll miss what you're looking for.,3
International Airport,It was entertaining I was on the blue side and the things I saw was hilarious. It was busy and quick in and out keep moving.,3
International Airport,It was ok..airline shorthanded on staff..but I made my flight 10min before take off...whew.üòÑ,3
International Airport,Concourse D crowded. Restaurants average. Clean and well marked. Short wait in line. Face covering policy uncomfortable and impersonal.  They need to push back against mandates.,3

International Airport,Actually our experience went well. The design for departures and arrivals is nuts.Once inside better. The wheel chairs are not very practical. A very busy airport long lines for popular foods and pricey. The agents and TSA ok. Best to travel early if possible. Once you get the gest of it manageable,3
International Airport,They should have better help for those that walk with a Cain. The DFW airport the employed driving the carts offer to help,3

Airport,"Once it was determined which gate to use, it was okay.",3
Airport,Large Airport with a variety of places to eat. However the food court area is somewhat crowded and expensive for the poor quality food and seemingly uncaring staff. Your best bet is go to one of the places you can sit down and order from the menus. Just my opinion.,3

Airport,"Small airport only 2 terminals so easy to figure out and hard to get lost. Just plan on a extra couple minutes to get from check in to the gates, you have to take a tram that runs about every 4 minutes or so.",3
Airport,There were no policemen out front. People were stopped and parked for over 20 minutes in the drive Lanes out front waiting for people to get off the planes. It was a klusterfuk. Google couldn't even get me the phone number to the Hartsfield police only sent me to customer service. At midnight it was absolutely no help.,3
Airport,Restaurants being closed except during mid day problem seems to be getting a little better,3

Airport,barely anything at this airport. no one checks if you have tsa precheck or not so you can skip the general line i guess. no one requires you to scan your boarding pass at security. so all you need is to show them your ID to get through security. most restaurants are closed due to covid. hardly any shops.,3

Airport,"Fun tram, tsa security was annoyingly cramped with people though",3

Airport,I mean - it's an airport.  If you're here it's because you don't have a choice.,3

Airport,"Crowed and way to far between gates for effective plane changes.  Delta needs to reopen Memphis as a hub.  It was when they bought Northwest, but they closed that and send everything East of the Mississippi to Atlanta.",3
Airport,"Signage has improved for TSA pre check. However, the construction is making parking a problem so you might want to consider parking off-site and taking the shuttle.",3
Airport,"Always use it several times a year and it's the usual fast pace in this airport TSA can be a rude and feel like they push it a bit to far, maybe seeking the extra attention or the need to ruin someones day. Aside of these wannabes its all good.",3
Airport,The airport runs smoothly. Bummer they took away all seating outside of the secure terminal areas.,3
Airport,"Airport is fine, none of the food services were open aside from chick fil a.",3
Airport,This airport is just to busy to have a layover In. The restaurants are basically fast food. The bathrooms are filthy just glad I stand lol,3
Airport,"The airport is different from any other. Confusing too. My gate number to Chicago was changed and because TSA check point was long, I didn't know until they called my name.",3
Airport,"I like this airport, but food service has been limited since covid, some restaurants have limited selections and close early.",3
Airport,"Zero smoking, which is understandable. No food other than Arby‚Äôs or McDonald‚Äôs after 9?! No adult beverages, got shut down.. At least by E gates it was. Plenty of expensive electronics though! Fastest tram car of any airport I‚Äôve ever been in.",3
Airport,"So after about 35 mins on the tarmac we have found a gate to park at. The bad news is we have no gate agent to drive the bridge over to the plane. May be another 30 mins. 

Ok NY. We are sending the south to show you how to run an airport. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport knows how this works.",3
Airport,I love watching the sunrise over atlairport,3
Airport,Always check the information on your ticket before you walk away from check in. Or even better check in online 4 hours before and arrive atleast 2 hours before your flight is scheduled for take off.,3
Airport,Flying Southwest is smooth and easy in Atlanta however Atlanta is known for delays,3
Airport,They need more places to buy alcohol At gate C,3
Airport,Always allow yourself enough time when flying to/from this airport,3
Airport,Easily accessed airport for early flight.  Currently flight is delayed over 1 1/2 hours with no apparent reason or update.,3
Airport,Busy airport. Not a lot of help around. The staff seems stressed.,3
Airport,Finish up with the construction please,3
Airport,"It was okay, busy airport as usual.",3
Airport,"It's a busy, busy airport because it's a Delta hub. They do their best but it takes a long time to get flights out anywhere near on time and don't take a last flight. Mine came in at midnight and it still took them almost 40 minutes to let us off. It's also a bad weather airport so just expect delays.",3
Airport,Bustling airport as you would expect from a Delta hub. Restaurants seem to close really early and it's very clear that staff is covid weary. Tempers are short and customer service is not what it was prior to the pandemic. Just be patient and understanding,3
Airport,Terminal F was lacking in food options.,3
Airport,"How are you changing the course? Water connects us all. changethecourseus

Airport,"It amazes me that the vendors in the airport no longer accept cash as payment. You must pay with debit or credit card. I can handle it but what about kids or people with no cards. Talk about discrimination, this is it plain and simple.",3
Airport,"Be ready to walk. To go from one place to another, not only you need to walk then take a train just to go get your luggage.",3
Airport,"I don't travel very much , but had a layover in Atlanta.
Very clean and organized operations.",3
Airport,Make sure to let people know whether your at the north or south terminal when getting picked up,3
Airport,Nice part of the airport. Starbucks is super busy always. Would be nice to have more quick food options.,3
Airport,"The long hallway just before Arrivals used to be my favorite part of the atlairport, but this man-made forest has taken the spot of the preferred walk, especially since Atlanta is now just a layover. Love the oasis in the middle of the busiest airport in the world. #oasis #airportstyle #layovers",3
Airport,Can anyone tell me if there are Chase ATM‚Äôs at Sacramento International Airport ?,3
Airport,"TSA employees rude and only look you in the eye when making a demand ... They want to be there less than you do.  Rental car agents, employees around the airport and airline employees are all helpful and friendly.",3
Airport,"If you have a long layover it is great, if you have a short layover you are in big trouble!",3
Airport,Avg airport. Needs remodeling. But it was fine. Not a lot of restaurants.,3
Airport,"Chaos and confusion abound, but plenty of shopping",3
Airport,"Big, confusing, lots of people, everyone wearing masks, mostly happy.",3
Airport,"It is the busiest airport I ever fly out of, but it is very efficient and up to date. So get there early to be prepared to wait in line.",3
Airport,"Large place but not enough signs or information.
So, check your route before you get there.",3
Airport,Annoying place to be when you have work to do. Imagine the largest gathering of rude obnoxious people imagined. Now multiply that by 10 and you have the ATL airport.,3
Airport,My FLIGHT RADAR APP was confirming the cancellation of Southwest Flights at my home airport Sacramento International Airport  as well besides San Antonio International Airport,3
Airport,Flight was canceled and I had to sit up all night untl this morning. Other than that it was clean.,3
Airport,Big Airport has a National and International side,3
Airport,The busiest this side of the Mississippi,3
Airport,More attention needs to be given to the wheel chair accessible...,3
Airport,"Got a little lost before baggage claim, because the tram did not say how to get to baggage claim clearly.
Other than that, All good.",3
Airport,"Easy to navigate to and from the airport and inside,  but the least friendly TSA staff of any airport we have been to.  They were trying to rush everyone thru security even though there was no line at all. Frustrating.",3
Airport,Place is always packed and you have to hustle to get where you want.,3
Airport,It's as good as can be expected for the  volume of traffic. Not enough handicapped parking IMO. Well maintained.,3
Airport,"ATL is the gold standard for all airports, however it is in need of maintenance and technology updates, ground transportation is definitely undermanned!",3
Airport,"The identifying signage could be better located and more visible (size, color,  bolder) for both parking and for the entrance to better help the elderly and handicapped.",3
Airport,Nothing exciting just crowded and food places closed too early. Of course everything was blamed on Covid. I would suggest hours for morning flights and the latest 8pm. ¬†Especially for those traveling with kids it's hard. Maybe add a few vegan options.,3
Airport,Good things going on at my HOME AIRPORT in Sac Town . I always miss out on this since I get dropped off at the airport by 3 am for first morning flight to San Antonio International Airport #sactown #flySanAntonio #flysmf #flysacramento #sacramentointernationalairport #sanantoniointernationalairport  #FLYSAT,3
Airport,This airport is pretty nasty. Gross bathrooms and there‚Äôs always food all over the gates.,3
Airport,Takes forever to get anywhere in this airport bit security was a breeze.,3
Airport,"I noticed some areas of the airport was a little bit dirty, so bad for a big nice international airport",3
Airport,Need to cut trees back and up more signs.,3
Airport,"Clean, organized, however didn't see police presence for such a HUGE airport",3
Airport,Dont get confused when you see the Metro Air exit which is before the Airport blvd exit.,3
Airport,Needs more specific signs out and inside the airport,3
Airport,TSA was a breeze to get through. Kinda disappointed that there aren't any restaurants open at 11am besides Starbucks.,3
Airport,Southwest Airlines needs to add NONSTOP to San Antonio International Airport since I always have to do a layover heading to the 210 üíõ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíô‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô #flySanAntonio #flysmf #flysacramento #FLYSAT #sacramentointernationalairport #sanantoniointernationalairport #southwestairlines,3
Airport,People are great that work there except customers are frustrated with TSA cause and problems sometime with other customers,3
Airport,Easy to navigate. Needs more restaurants/food/stores. Come 2 hours early if flying between 5:00-7:00 am or on holiday weeks/weekends.,3
Airport,Get there 2-3 hrs before your flight boards even on a sunday!!!!!!!!!!,3
Airport,"The room was really simple, somewhat clean. The tub was a little dirty. If you need a room just to sleep and shower quickly, nothing fancy, then this is the place. It took at least 20 minutes to check in.",3
Airport,It was smooth but definitely have to get there at a reasonable time if you plan to catch your flight. Didn't like that having a huge Airport you only had one dunkin donuts in which opened 1hr later than original time as expected and stated on Sunday. Also I had to remove my flip flops yes flip flops like never experienced that.,3
Airport,It was raining so the parking garage was full and took me over 15 to find a spot.,3
Airport,percheck was an hour wait at 9am,3
Airport,"I go though Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson a lot. It's a super busy airport and you need to give it some extra time going through here. The lines for security can be really long, but they do try to keep things moving. Once I'm through security I usually head to the club lounge. There's a train that takes you to the different gate areas or you can walk too. Lots of options for food.",3
Airport,"The people that work at this airport seem to have a collective goal of being rude, arrogant and having an attitude. Applies to shopowners and TSA reps. Bad experience.
Airport otherwise has a nice layout and looks good",3
Airport,Sacramento International Airport sure got a lot of rain and it never rains when it‚Äôs the day of my flight to San Antonio International Airport #flySanAntonio #flysacramento #flysmf #FLYSAT #sacramentointernationalairport #sanantoniointernationalairport,3

Airport,"A linear airport with a rail transit between terminals. ""When you die in the South, whether you're going to Heaven or Hell, there is a two hour layover at Hartsfield.""",3
Airport,Allow plenty of time to  make it through the screening checkpoint,3
Airport,"We arrived at 7pm instead of 5 because of a weather delay and there was nowhere to grab a bite to eat, so be prepared.",3
Airport,"East west, Frontier are in the first gate terminal B",3
Airport,"Bus driver , United airlines agents were helpful ,but seemed a bit stressed , even though it wasn‚Äôt busy .TSA lines move rapidly. Security checkpoint to United Airlines boarding gates is a long distance on foot . Hardly any golf carts were available .",3
Airport,Domestically..it has to be the busiest.,3
Airport,"Too big, an hour's walk inside, and waiting for check-in over an hour and a half,",3
Airport,"The safe decibel level for airplanes flying over is 65 and under. üò≤ We have 70 to 80 every 1 to 2 minutes and the airport is trying to tell me that we are not in the curve for the FIP program. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¨

Airport,It was good a lot of walking and that train was different to fast for me.,3
Airport,Its an international terminal so its farther away. Nothing special here except duty-free.,3
Airport,"It's okay.  Nothing special.  Just a very big, impersonal airport.  You can definitely tell that Delta runs the place!  The plane train is great!",3
Airport,Service was great. restrooms too small. This lounge in concourse B is way too crowded. Delta sky lounge,3
Airport,"I saw this yesterday in our San Antonio International Airport - we lost such an amazing tradition. At the same time, proud that our #HispanicHeritageMonth2021 #hispanicheritage are celebrating it

This is so close to what we celebrate in Indian Subcontinent - PitruPaksha time of year. #HinduHeritageMonth

Shubha Deepavai to all",3
Airport,"Big airport, but it feels small",3
Airport,"It's an airport! It gets you where you need to go. It would be nice to have more seats on the tram to Terminal B, and exit signage could be clearer. But all said, it's not the worst.",3
Airport,I wonder why Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport doesn't have a theater. It just seemed like the obvious thing to do because it's a mall ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,3
Airport,seemed nice..too bad all the restaurants were closed at 9:30,3
Airport,This is a very busy place. Lots of walking.,3
Airport,Plan your rideshare as soon as you get of the plane,3
Airport,This Airport will give you a real workout. Be prepared for a good walk,3
Airport,It's an okay but busy airport. Signage could use a major overhaul as well as the security check lines. Restrooms are generally clean and stocked. Information on what restaurants & stores are located in each terminal would be helpful to the traveler. Especially when some terminals are bare in amenities and food choices.,3
Airport,After 8 pm restaurants close with 100s of travelers. Why do they all close?,3
Airport,Very large airport  and very crowded,3
Airport,"There on a Wednesday night to pick someone up. So many cars trying to get through at any given moment. If you have patience go ahead and get in that mess. If not, pay the money for short term parking.",3
Airport,"Not the best... not the worst. Airport has some pretty good restaurants, and has a logical layout. I'm accustomed to flying in here and don't mind it.",3
Airport,Spent over an hour going through TSA alone. After that getting to my terminal via the train was a breeze. The flight was smooth pleasant.,3
Airport,Always busy. But I always get to where I need to be.,3
Airport,"Ok airport, still a little confusing, staff was ok going through the checkpoint, they were pretty fast. Wasn't the cleanest but still definitely not the worst.",3
Airport,"An easy way to catch your breath while picking someone up at Sacramento airport if you are early, or their flight is delayed. No driving around and around the terminals, being told by airport security to keep moving since passengers are not ready for pickup. Easy access and free.",3
Airport,The arrival and departure gates to far.,3
Airport,That Starbucks at San Antonio International Airport is out of regular milk! How does that happen?,3
Airport,"Crowded, people without masks... allow lots of time for security. Even TSA precheck has long lines",3
Airport,"Long walk, a train ride, and a quiet place this Tuesday.",3
Airport,"Post COVID experience was good, the waiting time through security much quicker although it could have been better. There is always room for improvement.  However, I was dissatisfied with TSA discarding one's foot (guacamole) saying it can be spread. Now I understand the need to eliminate potential threats but a food item?? Where is common sense ???",3
Airport,Pickup your arriving passengers on the departure side of the building less congestion,3
Airport,My experience varied. Good going on way not so good going another.,3

Airport,ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE OF A WEAPON Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Pray everyone is ok,3
Airport,"If you know someone traveling thru the Hartsfield-Jackson airport, officials say there was an ‚Äòaccidental discharge‚Äô of a weapon in a security area...",3
Airport,Justin flew out of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport this morning prior to whatever shooting incident took place. He is safe and sound. Praying my nephews and all the students traveling make it home safely.,3
Airport,An accidental gun discharge at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport caused panicked travelers to flee and briefly halted departures Saturday afternoon.,3
Airport,Rumors of an active shooter at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport left travelers scared and confused Saturday until the airport announced a firearm had been accidentally discharged.,3
Airport,I was LITERALLY in Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport earlier today and left shortly before this happened! All is well and I made it safely!,3
Airport,"Checking in was okay, but every food place was closed except Freshi who had only vegetarian fare (no protein) and a bar that sold 16-dollar hamburgers and, since they were the only food available, there was a 20-minute wait just to place your order. There should be food available for people waiting for flights.",3
Airport,I can‚Äôt believe they really tryna cover up the shooting at the airport todayüôÑ . I guess my mama was on FaceTime screaming & running for dear life for no reason just panicking let them tell it Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,3
Airport,It wasn‚Äôt to bad other then people that are waiting for there ride like to stand in the middle of the street which blocks traffic.,3
Airport,"Ok so if you didn‚Äôt know, my parents are pilots and some people ask what the stupidest free thing we did was using there airline benefits! So here it is, Delta airlines has a museum of their history in there base ATL. So we flew down for a day checked out the museum, and went home all in the same dayü§™!",3
Airport,Crazy because I am a small town girl in this huge place.,3
Airport,Airport and flight was fine.  Witnessed the baggage handlers throwing bags onto the tarmac.  And the food court was a joke.  Most restaurants out of product; serving limited menus but not bothering to tell you until you're at the order point yet the menu boards showing everything.,3
Airport,Nice airport. Very compact. Only downside is that many restaurants are closed. The airport authority needs to find new tenants to be there to provide services to the flying public.,3
Airport,"Coldest morning of the season in Atlanta! Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport dipped to 32 degrees this AM, the coldest since April 2 when it registered 33 degrees. Below is a roundup of some of our coldest spots this morning... How cold did it get at your house?",3
Airport,"Got there around 7:30.  Long lines at the few food places open.  After 3 hours, all the coffee places (which I really need in the morning) were STILL closed!!  I like Atlanta's airport but open up earlier!!",3
Airport,On holiday season  get to the airport 3 HOURS EARLY,3
Airport,Decent airport. Definitely disappointed there are no more smoking lounges.,3
Airport,What a crazy experience. There was apparently a fire arm discharge in one of the terminals and we went on full lock down. ¬†That was a crazy few minutes for sure. ¬†U just never know what's going to happen when your traveling anymore,3
Airport,"Oh Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Delta Air Lines I have missed you and glad to be back, just passing through.",3
Airport,It is usually busy and they need more TSA workers for manage to long lines. Shopping and restaurants are closed,3
Airport,3+ places people come out from flights/not well marked,3
Airport,Not my favorite airport but it was okay,3
Airport,They made me check my bag when I dint want to other than that it's an airport,3
Airport,Good place to wait without harassment from security or anybody,3
Airport,Luckily I can read signs or else I'd be lost.,3
Airport,Security takes an awful long time but ATL is handling traffic pretty well all things considered.,3
Airport,For being a 24hr airport you would hope for restaurants open a bit later than 8pm.,3
Airport,"Getting through security, making our way around the terminal, all flawless. What really irritated us as we passed through the ATL airport was that at least half of the restaurants were either closed or closed at 6pm. This made it really difficult to find somewhere to eat because everything was packed.",3
Airport,It would be nice if there was one at Sacramento International Airport in TERMINAL B #flySanAntonio #flysmf #flysacramento #FLYSAT #sacramentointernationalairport #sanantoniointernationalairport #automatedpizzakitchen #pizza,3

Airport,Crazy this was my first visit to this airport you will need a guide dog,3
Airport,I'm home.  Merry Christmas at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,3
Airport,Not my favorite airport but it gets the job done. Staff ok!,3

Airport,First time at F gates. Sparse restaurants close at 8 pm eastern.,3
Airport,Said every restaurant closes at night,3
Airport,Getting coffee was a little tough this morning but other than that it's typical ATL.,3
Airport,This airport is crowded & small in the terminal that I was in. But it did have lots of shops to look at.,3
Airport,This is a big place I am so glad I can read because if you couldn‚Äôt you would not be able to get around here it‚Äôs full of signs ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇüòÇ,3
Airport,"We flew in on a Saturday and trying to find someone to ask for assistance was almost impossible.
Finally, I found a police officer that was able to direct me in the right location.",3
Airport,"Security moved rapidly, but it was a Sunday. Very clean. Not  enough  seats  near the  gates, people  sitting on  floor  everywhere.",3
Airport,How does Atlanta airport one of the busiest in America has TSA pre-check close at 9pm on Sunday!  NOT GOOD!  traveler check the hours of TSA!,3
Airport,"Larger airport, typical stuff, food court, overpriced magazine stands. Most staff were friendly, restrooms were worst than most.",3
Airport,"Nice airport,  but no dining after 7 pm?",3
Airport,Travel is almost back to normal......ATL is back to it busy self.,3
Airport,"When December 8 opened up more Southwest Airlines flights from my HOME AIRPORT Sacramento International Airport to San Antonio International Airport  here‚Äôs the latest updates on mask mandates for TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS between the 916 and the 210. 

",3
Airport,"The airport is clean and easy to navigate with all the signage.

Only thing is it seems to attract people down on their luck.  One fellow stole some candy and ate it in one of shops.  Lady running the place confronted him as we were walking by.  Nothing hostile.  How too address the draw of such a warm open public place and people in need.",3
Airport,"Massive place, not the easiest place to go from Terminal to Terminal. So make sure you have more than enough time if you have to change Terminals.",3
Airport,TSA checkpoint was quick and efficient.  The Departure and Arrival dashboard were easily accessible to determine the time and gate number for my flight ‚úàÔ∏è.   One thing that I  thought was weird and inconvenient was not being able to access concourse A from Concourse B.  Signage is needed to make customers aware that you can't pass through one concourse to reach the other concourse.,3
Airport,So many people! And 2 trains? Wow!,3
Airport,"I had to wait the night for my flight, the people that clean the floor with the loud machines did so in the same spot all night in order for the ones there to not be  able to rest. There is no place to get food in the middle of the night. The airport was very clean.",3
Airport,Make sure you go downstairs and follow rideshare signs if using Uber/Lyft.,3
Airport,"I was leaving the airport and decided to take some random shots‚Ä¶.

Airport,"Good morning and happy Monday from a very festive Hartsfield-Jackson! Safe travels this week, friends! ‚úàÔ∏è",3
Airport,"The airport was decent but masking was not enforced and the ""courtesy carts"" driving inside are disruptive. If they are that important they should have a dedicated lane instead of honking and making travelers move quickly out of the way. The intercom system was difficult to hear.",3
Airport,"On my way to New Jersey via Atlanta,  as always it's extremely busy but everyone's got to mask up.",3

Airport,This airport is so huge. You can get lost and turned around easily if you don't know where you're going.,3
Airport,It was fast service. Need to be more strict on people wearing masks,3
Airport,Very smooth transition during busy holiday season!  Cleanliness was lower than expected but lines moving was a huge plus. Follow best mommy and daughter for more family fun reviews,3
Airport,"The airport was the perfect size to get in and out for a family traveling to the Napa area. Checking in and security were easy. I'd give it 4-5 masks were optional. I know it's out of their control but it's hard to enjoy the airport fully while wearing masks.
That being said there were great food options to choose from at the gates.",3
Airport,"Super busy and crowded, wear good walking shoes. Lots of familiar eateries. Also be aware, everyone does not wear a mask or wear it properly.",3
Airport,Busier than ever but due to covid it couldn‚Äôt be helped the airport was short staffed,3
Airport,"With all the staff shortage, I would recommend getting there 3 hours in advance.",3
Airport,"Giant airport and it never fails your gates will be opposite ends of airport but the always crowded train gets u there on time. A diverse crowd, mostly ignorant but typical city for area. Airport was clean, lots of hand sanitizer areas, convenient restrooms, just know that if u travel late a lot of the interior shops will be closed. Seating in gate areas was limited due to the plandemic.",3
Airport,"Dirty with sticky ground. Food court is trashful. Not many food stores open. Security check is not well organized. Compared to DIA, it still requires shoe and belt off. The tram to rental car center is really convenient though!",3
Airport,"Not crazy about Atlanta airport. Never have been. It was ok, however the soap in the womans bathroom STINKS...it gave me a headache and now its all i cam smell....Nasty...",3
Airport,what a nightmare that airport is...BUT the staff they have working there...are amazingly nice and helpful!,3
Airport,Try to avoid if you can - the layout and organisation of the check-in and security check is terrible  - giving 3 stars because the staff and TSA were helpful and did a good job with a friendly attitude in spite of how badly the airport is laid out/organised for them and passengers.,3
Airport,most of the employees I interacted w/ were rude. parking attendants are super friendly & helpful! if u don‚Äôt like ur job‚Äî QUIT! ITS THAT SIMPLE!!,3

Airport,"Nice airport, very organized but gigantic. It takes 3 trains, 5 escalators and about 2 miles to get from the rental car drop to the gate. Security is fast, so that's a plus. I'd have given it 4 stars but I've been to better airports.",3

Ended up waiting for an hour for them to open the bag drop counter. Not very nice assuming it's an a 5am flight.",3
Airport,Despite the 1 hour delay...and the lack of working charging Stations it was ok,3

Airport,"BA staff were excellent and security ok. Sadly, just about every eating place was closed by 7pm on a Friday night. I have used this airport before but this was the worst experience.",3
Airport,"It needs clearer, more prominent signage. The signs directing one to the hotel shuttles seem to be only positioned in the middle of baggage claim rather close to that specific set of doors. There should be signs in other areas of baggage claim at the other exit doors too, otherwise one has to wander around to various doors until you get lucky and find the doors to the hotel shuttles in question.",3
Airport,"Confusing as all heck! Went to pick up my friend, couldn't find the correct terminal. I finally had to stop and ask 2 officers outside terminal B how on earth to get over to Terminal A.

However, the waiting area before the terminals was a good place to wait, if you arrive early.",3
Airport,TSA agents were rude and indifferent as always but Sac International has no control over that. Easy in and the terminal was clean.,3
Airport,Love the train and the layout of airport. Dislike road signs getting you there and seeing one TSA officer in check in and a long unnecessary line...,3
Airport,"Decent airport, but the light rail is very primitive.  Requires buying a paper ticket or plastic card.  Modern light rail uses apps and Apple Pay",3
Airport,The tsa here are difficult at times. Not sure why they are so uptight but I suspect short staffed.,3
Airport,"Nice airport. My only complaint is the lack of chairs and tables to sit at in the atrium part of the airport. I understand the need for social distancing during the pandemic, but this is ridiculous. I had to literally stand up and eat a meal.",3
Airport,Moved steady but give yourself plenty of time for tsa,3
Airport,"(Translated by Google) Okay !!!

(Original)
Bueno !!!",3
Airport,"The airport is alright. But pick your flight connections early, all food places and stores close at 9:00pm.",3
Airport,"There are not enough seats while waiting at the gate. The seats that are there are small. Also, nothing is open to get something to eat before an early morning flight.",3
Airport,I don‚Äôt know what airport this is can someone help?!,3
Airport,"Not a bad airport to visit, just hate that connecting flights are so far apart and you're only given 30 to 45 mins to get to your next gate. Barely have time to use the restroom or something to eat in that timeframe.",3
Airport,For the most part people are using thier masks. It is still relatively crowded for a covid era. Most of the restuarants are still operational and some on a modified schedule.  Masks are mandatory on all flights and in the airport.,3
Airport,There‚Äôs definitely a lot of art related displays as well at my HOME AIRPORT Sacramento International Airport  but everything at San Antonio International Airport represents the HEYDAYS of the 210 and what it is today and the future #flySanAntonio #flysmf #flysacramento #FLYSAT #BlackHistoryMonth #sacramentointernationalairport #sanantoniointernationalairport,3

Airport,"Good- managing such huge traffic
Bad- uber/Lyft pick up has a long walk. Something you won‚Äôt love in the cold",3
Airport,"Fine, except transfer between Delta flight was a hike in different terminals.",3
Airport,yesterday I came from international flight I checked my baggage in San Antonio airport line up but fortunately I find in american line office instead of baggage area because not guided me but why please question of the day,3
Airport,"As big and nice as the airport is, I didn't like that some people either were not or were improperly wearing their masks.",3
Airport,"Just look out for gate changes, it's a large airport üèÉ",3
Airport,Drop off and pick up from terminal A is confusing because of poor signage! Lines for check in and security inside airport aren't as bad as other airports. Much rather fly through SMF then other airports!,3
Airport,"The exit to get to the Domestic terminal is small and a dangerous traffic hazard, I recommend using the exit for the international side. You still get to the airport you just have to loop around.",3
Airport,"I like SAC because it is easy to get in and out of. They have a parking lot that is free to wait for incoming flights. ( has a port a potty )
No hassle moving around inside the terminal.",3
Airport,Pretty crowded now .Lines now in front of Check in.Security speedy though.Gate agents  are happy and helpful.Be Suuper early!,3
Airport,"It's an airport. It's clean. Employees are sometimes friendly, sometimes not. Nothing amazing or surprising.
They sure don't act like we're in a pandemic here. People are so gross.",3
Airport,It would have been nice if more was open for late flights ‚úàÔ∏è.,3
Airport,"First time there. Very busy and big. Road the train for the first time. Won't go there ever again. First time experience, last time experience. üòäüòä",3
Airport,Connecting flights are NEVER in the same terminal and also have go 3 or 4 terminals to get connections. It's really hard for someone who has mobility issues,3
Airport,"Great accessibility and transportation considering the size of the airport but during peak travel days and hours, the staff seemed to be a bit overwhelmed. Things became really unorganized. Still better than LAX though.",3
Airport,Anybody know what the emergency was all about at 1 am? Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,3
Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Please remove Atlanta from your name due to recent claims in the Rap world you are not Atlanta you are on the southside.,3
Airport,Need a comfortable one hour between flights.  Had forty and barely made it from D to A concourse.  Large place.  Remember the tram is your friend.,3
Airport,Prices were okay. Bathrooms were a little gross.,3
Airport,Very confusing signage or lacking signage at the airport. Very clean and beautiful though.,3
Airport,A lil unorganized but made out ok,3
Airport,Really busy but has alot of places to get food and drinks,3
Airport,Very modern facilities and well run..I liked the tram to the B gates. The restaurants unfortunately are extremely overpriced. A chicken sandwich and a beer ran me $30 without tip.,3
Airport,"Fast and efficient airport. Train to rentals easy. The biggest issue is that the shops/restaurants do not open on time, or even close. Of course it is busy, but the efficiency helps.",3
Airport,Not the easiest airport to find your way around in and I spent my 2 hour layover freezing! Do they not have heat? Goodness. Riding the air train was fun!,3
Airport,"It is said that once you have had a taste of spiritual awakening ‚Äî feeling yourself not as a separate, isolated self but as the undulating flow of Being exploring and knowing itself ‚Äî you can never fully go back to sleep. But you can take naps!

Good Thursday morning from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.",3
Airport,where is my Uber Uber Uber lol Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport here I come,3
Airport,Customs at this airport were extremely nasty! Other than that the airport was fine.,3
Airport,"Clean, but tired staff, need more flexible hours probably",3
Airport,Really short lines if u have clear,3
Airport,"Plus points: For the number of people who fly in/out, this airport is very well managed and organized. Train is nice. Food selection is great.
Con: Too many people and almost always crowded during weekends and peak times which leads to no parking issue and over-crowding near security lines. Staff is short-tempered and jaded.

Chik-fil-A and Popeyes is the way to go.",3
Airport,"Very nice, clean airport. Well organized but busy.",3
Airport,The airport is huge I almost missed my flight .I really needed a ride down to Gate 57 but instead I had to run halfway there.i almost died but I did catch my flight.,3
Airport,If you are into a long walk and changing Gates this airport is great. And making reservations for your Airlines please consider having at least a two two two and a half hour layover so you can get from gate that you land into the gates you depart.,3
Airport,"This airport is just too big for its own good. Parts have been updated and are well marked, other areas have not. Depending on the terminal, rest rooms are not always easily identified. If your connecting flight is in another terminal, with a short layover, you may need to run.",3
Airport,I wonder if they will be around at 3 am when I check in for first morning Southwest Airlines flight to San Antonio International Airport #flySanAntonio #flysmf #flysacramento #FLYSAT #sacramentointernationalairport #saantoniointernationalairport #southwestairlines,3
Airport,"Massive airport. This last time we used it in Nov 2021 we were able to get in and out with relative ease. I would not go out of my way to use this airport unless I came across a phenomenal deal like I did last time or want to cut down on connections and layovers. The drive is roughly 4 hours each way from Charlotte, NC.",3
Airport,Very busy give yourself plenty of time to walk to everything,3
Airport,"Airport is decent, but could do with an update to bring it more inline with the other large/international hubs.
Was stuck there for a 7h delay due to a cancelled flight and it was difficult during peak hours to get a seat with an outlet to charge my phone and not bother other peoples ""Covid sensibilities"".",3
Airport,"Vegas has been fun, but time for the trip back East to Tampa, Florida. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the layover stop before going home.",3
Airport,"Clean. Still has a low number of customers.
Our flight got canceled tonight. The plane we were supposed to board had a landing gear malfunction for which a mechanic had to be brought from Salt Lake. We booked the next flight at 5:30am.",3
Airport,Had breakfast at Chick Fli A on concourse A.,3
Airport,Off to Sacramento International Airport inshaAllah ‚ù§Ô∏è,3
Airport,TSA is much striker than other airport.,3
Airport,"Jody Atlam.  Not sure of last name.  She was supposed to be cleaning bathroom near gate C20 at 10:15 am. However, she was on her phone and using very profane language.",3
Airport,Just an airport kind of moves. Kind of quick. You can get in and out. The gates are kind of close together. It's just an airport,3
Airport,"It was okay but for all the people talking about they need a job, they need to apply at the airport! I left on a Tuesday afternoon and waited in the security line for over an hour because they had ONE PERSON CHECKING ID?!",3
Airport,"Since we were last here six months ago, restaurants in Terminal T have opened back up, though the options are meager.  Find much better choices outside security.",3
Airport,"We now arrived into Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport next flight is at 12:55am the next morning off to DCA Washington, so then we hop off our plane and make our way right to our next aircraft to DCA to Chicago O'Hare International Airport tomorrow!",3
Airport,If my Southwest Airlines flight to San Antonio International Airport was tomorrow morning I would have to be ready by 1 am to leave and since there‚Äôs no traffic to Sacramento International Airport I would be dropped off within 45 minutes,3
Airport,"Made it to Atlanta after some oddness with my tickets back in Roanoke 

Next stop: Birmingham, Alabama 

#flyatlanta #deltaairlines #travel #airport #atlanta",3
Airport,Get there early. Security line can get pretty long.,3
Airport,"Very busy, with people every where.",3
Airport,Good traffic cops a little rude,3
Airport,Crazy busy.  Bustling airport construction in some areas makes things a little interesting.  There was a very angry woman yelling at passengers near the hotel pick up so beware of her!!,3
Airport,"While ATL certainly provides a lot of opportunities for various flight routes, it's always incredibly busy. The TSA lines always seem to be extra long even with pre-check. On-site parking isn't any better. It would be nice if some of the smaller airports nearby could take some of the weight off this airport to ease some of its craziness. The food and decor is pretty good though.",3
Airport,"While trying to find the elusive dino skeleton ?which we did t fond, and no one seemed to know how to actually get there), we found this gem between concourses. Sounds, lights and sights attract even the most tired of passengers.",3
Airport,"While helpful with the situation they checked our wheelchair rather then have it ready at terminal. And at first, said someone else might of taken it (not knowing it was just checked) signs guiding to the other half of baggage claim not easily noticable so took awhile to find where we needed to go.
A lot of unneeded vacation stress",3
Airport,The airport is nice just we didn't get our baggage when we arrived in belize. Really hoping we get it today as they promised to deliver.,3
Airport,Allow yourself the full 2 hours. This airport is a city and security gets really backed up,3
Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport  waiting for flight back to Newark. 1hr delay puts departure at 9:56pm. mask mandate? Lolipop has that covered!,3
Airport,It‚Äôs early. I‚Äôm at San Antonio International Airport and coffee is not open BUT they are rocking Huey Lewis and the News and The Police so my rating has jumped from 3 stars to 4 stars.,3
Airport,"Crowded as ever, but no problems",3
Airport,Good service but it's a very confusing airport for me lol,3
Airport,My 1st time there from Toronto was AWESOME Pre Covid Love it so much went back this weekend was disappointed under Construction so when I arrived I was ushered to Dom in stead of Int so my friends were at the wrong place but on the brighter note I seen ALOT of ATL Airpot then I did the 1st time No DUTY FREE BOOZE SMOKES PERFUME NOTHING Except KYLIE JENNER !!!!! BAHAHAHAA,3
Airport,If April 26 is a GREEN LIGHT for San Antonio International Airport  I know I‚Äôll be ready to be in SacTown by 3 am for first morning departure to the 210. üíõ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíô‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô #flySanAntonio #flysmf #FLYSAT #flysacramento #sanantoniointernationalairport #sacramentointernationalairport #southwestairlines,3
Airport,Much better than the domestic terminal. Domestic terminal is ruined because of Delta.,3
Airport,"Not a bad airport to get through, staff is friendly. My big complaint is that at 6pm there is only two places open to eat, and they both are packed with an 1hr+ wait times.",3
Airport,"TSA. I have been all over the world and in some Questionable airports. THE TSA HERE IS THE WORSE. TSA is a federal employee with good pay and retirement.  If you are that unhappy, find another govt job. The most rude, mean, angry people that even treat old ladies the worst. Have some respect to the elderly please!",3
Airport,"Considering the potential long walks, they should have installed some people movers",3
Airport,Come early for a easier process,3
Airport,"Although I reported that had pre clearance, I was required to go through anyway",3
Airport,"They really need to make some changes to their disability assistance. Guy wheeled me to the wrong gate, took me overworked minutes to get the attention of the employees nearby and nobody would call for assistance helping me get to a restroom. That being said, TSA was very helpful and kind as well as the aircraft staff. United.",3
Airport,Very big airport. We kinda got lost,3
Airport,Security doing way too much... Starting to see why the gate worker got punched,3
Airport,That's so not busy this time around. Covid-19 has made the busiest airport not busy. //  28 MAR 2022 BAVK TO NORMAL.  ü§ü,3
Airport,"Confusing signage getting to the airport led us to having to take another lap to get to our scheduled destination. On the plus side, it wasn't very crowded at all.",3
Airport,"Easy-in, easy-out. Only two shuttle bus available on this day. Waited longer than those who are going downtown. The drop-off and on location is just outside the arrival zone on any terminal, not on the departure area.",3
Airport,Great airport if you fly in by 6pm. We flew from Seattle to atlanta. If you weren't in first class there was no food service on the plane. When we arrived in Atlanta at 10pm no food places were open. Also some of the vending machines weren't working. I believe if you have a concourse open with flights having 1 food place open would be helpful.,3
Airport,"First time coming to this airport. It is  quite a big airport. Plus had to ask someone who works there for help Almost got lost getting from and too my destination. But at least, I got there. Just wish they had those information booths were someone that's there, can help you when needed. Thank you",3
Airport,"If you do depart outbound for international flights (in the afternoon) It has only 1 restaurant open. With only 2 things on the menu left. We went to Concourse E (I think), and we found a nice restaurant to eat at. So domestic terminals have more choices even though flights are much shorter (most of the flights)",3
Airport,My hometown - airport is super crowded but not too bad only 11 mins in TSA line on a Sunday.,3
Airport,Delta Pilots and the airplane staff are very professional and polite but your parking ticket staff are horrible and unprofessional. Machines do not work and the attitudes we receive from the employees managing the parking ticket process need to receive some type of training on professionalism and sense of urgency.,3
Airport,It's a very busy airport. I would suggest arriving early just to get through TSA.,3
Airport,"Busy. Had to be on stand by on 3 different flies, slept at the airport until 2 nice ladies help us out Lilyleth and Shanika. Thanks God we made it home sunday instead of tuesday. Thank you ladies. Blessings!!!",3
Airport,"The security check point needs more operators.. And I had an early flight to avoid such long lines, but still waited 45 minutes getting through",3
Airport,"A massive and inefficient airport. A good idea, but really missed the mark with the conveyor belt system:",3
Airport,"Terminal D : Time to add some upgrades. Better seating and perhaps some spots with tables and receptacles/charging stations?
Perhaps add the flight boarding time to the gate display/flight information so it is a little more useful to your customers? Really not sure why it isn't displayed? Seems simple enough to do.",3
Airport,"Make sure to show up 3 hours before your domestic flight boarding, not just 2. Organized, but VERY busy and lots of travelers.",3
Airport,Dont take it for granted.. show up 2hrs before your flight or even more if possible.. its better to wait than misss your flight..,3
Airport,"Nice place plenty of places to eat, however being an international airport, they should have a smoking area, similar to Korea and other major hubs",3
Airport,Extremely busy yesterday and today.,3
Airport,Typical airport.  Tram runs between terminals.  A little surprised that crepe and yogurt restaurant was closed at 7 am,3
Airport,I really don't mind the airport but I also don't like it. Security is always a drag and unpredictable.,3
Airport,The restaurants need to stay open later...it's ATL people geez.,3
Airport,Bring a reusable water bottle so you don't have to buy one for $17 here!,3
Airport,Lots of signs/directions. But need moving walks. Especially on the way home people are exhausted.,3
Airport,"As I was only picking sum1 up, it was still very crowded. People were still wearing masks.",3
Airport,"On the plus side, this is a small airport so security lines are never long. The down side, you will never get a direct flight to anywhere. The airport itself is a tad outdated but, you'll still find power built in to the seats to charger your electronics. There is a small selection of stores and restaurants and just like any airport- it is all over priced.",3
Airport,"The only thing I can complain about is the TSA check, how one airport check is much different from the other. I had the same items in my carry-on going to and leaving Atlanta, but Atlanta needs to double check /rescan what I have. Their scanners are super sensitive. I get it, it's just annoying.",3
Airport,Hudson News nearby Gate E has excellent cold foods selection. Chicken salad wrap is one of the best with good friendly customer service.,3
Airport,Some travelers cheered the news at San Antonio International Airport ‚Äî but others weren't happy about the change.,3
Airport,"My only complaint is that my travel sized toothpaste, body wash and lotion was removed from my checked baggage!",3
Airport,Had a cappuccino before boarding our flight.,3
Airport,"It's less crowded then lax, I can tell you that. This is the last time, I'll ever fly a red eye...3 hour layover to Asheville,north Carolina is no joke. I am sleepy.. it is 7am here and it is only 4am back in los Angeles.. I hope I make it.. I am Soo sleepy..",3
Airport,The step child of Texas airports! Easier to navigate DFW or IAH but you'd rather fly into SAT!Signs are misleading but us Texans are super friendly so just ask for directions. Lots of dining options and shopping. Just needs a face lift. I haven't flown into SAT in a decade. Remember the Alamo!,3
Airport,Very big and busy. Get here a little early even on off peak hours. Felt like a lot of disorganization and hurry up and wait. Gate staff is a hit or miss as far as attitude and courtesy.,3
Airport,"It's a small, well organized airport. The only complaint that I would have is that it seemed to not have its food court staffed and scaled for the amount of traffic. The length of lines made it such that it wasn't reasonable to even get a couple coffee.",3
Airport,Great place if you want to wait for a shuttle for 30 minutes. Enjoy,3
Airport,The passengers and I had to wait 30 min just to get our luggage,3
Airport,Its okay...way too big of an airport to make connecting flights in different terminals,3
Airport,It is huge & lines move quickly,3
Airport,"Walked out to the Lyft pickup spot. Parking lot looked decidedly average:  Pavement with lines demarcating where cars should position themselves, arrows designating which way to travel, signage of varying sorts. You know‚Ä¶a parking lot. I‚Äôm so bored.",3
Airport,I love the service of the airport but they need to have longer hours for food venders. They close up when people are still arriving and connecting.,3
Airport,"Some will say that the first stop on the way to hell is Atlanta International...To me it wasn't so bad. I have to admit that it was the first time I have ever ridden a ""train"" to go from one part of an airport to another.",3
Airport,It's getting really busy again. It was so nice to fly during the pandemic no one was at the airport. Clear might be something to invest in because lines are long .,3
Airport,"Very impressive train system to navigate terminals but rather disorganized international disembarking process, and for the ""Busiest and most effecient airport in the world"", the bathrooms and general facility could stand to impress a tad more.",3
Airport,"Had a fire alarm go off, And had a 20 min waiting time for the train",3
Airport,"They managed to have a 40 minute long security line at 4:30 AM. The rest of the airport is pretty well run, but TSA, not so much.",3
Airport,"With all construction, it's very confusing trying to get around abd find where you need to go. Need seats where you wait for arrivals in the south terminal.",3
Airport,A very well traveled airport. I normally to try avoid it as it is ridiculously busy.,3
Airport,"Used to love a layover here. There was a great, fun bar with an enclosed smoking section.  But no longer a smoking area. Oh well, at least I'll save a lot $$. Used to spend 50+ during my layovers here.",3
Airport,"Day and night difference between domestic and international terminals. Domestic; dirty, crowded, terrible long waiting lines (I almost missed my connection) International; the opposite, clean, spacious, smooth check in and security.",3
Airport,It was a beautiful flight home. Thanks to the guy I‚Äôm my aisle for giving me the window seat.,3
Airport,"It was late, everything was closed. Great looking stores,stored, have loved to have done some shopping.",3
Airport,"If I could rate different gates then this rating would be higher. The rest of the airport is amazing, D gate smells like urine. Not an enjoyable time waiting for a plane.",3
Airport,"Arrived at airport 4 1/2 hours early ( Long story)
Couldn't check baggage in, new rule that you can't check baggage in 4 hours early. So we had to waited 35 minutes till we could check in baggage under 4 hours",3
Airport,"Airport is still busy after COVID-19, but still works pretty well.  However, some shopping, and a lot of dining, are not open.",3
Airport,"Apart from connecting flights with the same airline, being a great distance apart
and sitting an extensive time at the terminal in the plane upon arrival, because Delta could not find their driver to connect the access portal to the terminal, it is a decent airport.",3
Airport,"You definitely need to arrive, and fly out early in the morning. If you don't, you're in for a long travel day.",3
Airport,"It's a busy US airport, I mean it could be worse and it could be better.
The tram is very fast and efficient, you just have to know your Gate info so you can plan your connections well",3
Airport,"Very big, you need to walk a long way for arrival or departure, mostly empty. Very few shops, half of them closed.",3
Airport,Ok airport. On the car mack for a hour.,3
Airport,"The airport was clean and staffers were friendly. Just didn't like seeing how many people were not wearing mask, there was coughing and sneezing going on which was very uncomfortable for me. Too many people and covid still on the rise, Mask should be worn at all times just to keep everyone safe.",3
Airport,Some of the airline agents need more sleep so we can answer questions politely üò°,3
Airport,I work at Chicago O'Hare Airport and we have work to do to get as good as Hartsfield Airport.,3
Airport,"Too large.
ATL should be split-up.",3
Airport,Getting ready for takeoff at atlairport in the all new #pmdg737 for msfsofficial!,3
Airport,I never seem to get a flight were my layover is at a gate close to one another. I'm always hauling butt from gate A to E or F. It is a clean airport and most staff is nice unless you go to the good court there service is awful and terrible attitudes.,3
Airport,"Crowded as usual.  Give yourself plenty of extra time. On the other hand, most flights are direct",3
Airport,"Very busy.  I landed on C, didn't know B was a different train. Didn't see B sign and walked down to D train.  Had to go back up and cross the very busy terminal to go down to B train.  Why isn't there a passage on the train level to between the B and D Trains?",3
Airport,"Was kinda scared to go pick up my daughter by myself , I had never been to sac before google maps mad it worry free including 2 speed traps which was also helpful . Thank you for the guidence.",3
Airport,Busy Airport. Parking for passenger pickup and drop off can be intense with the construction.,3
Airport,"A very very busy place. I‚Äôm on the E concourse. It looks a bit dated and could use a good cleaning, the latter being pretty problematic with all of the traffic. Restaurants are packed at 07:30 in the morning.",3
Airport,"What happened to Sweet Auburn Avenue at the international terminal. It was always a favorite of mine. other than that, it was just an ok experience.",3
Airport,"Quick check in, security was SLOW...get there early!",3
Airport,"Let me say the first leg of this trip was extraordinary in every way. The return OMG
Everything that could go wrong  did., it took for ever to just get to tsa later on for getting through. I fell hard trying to get in the airport. Thanks to the two angles who helped me up and in.",3
Airport,Was a little confusing but we figured it out,3
Airport,"Very big airport , if you have to switch terminals your looking at a godd 30 minute!",3
Airport,"Long, long queues to clear customs for non-US nationals. Then no hotel shuttle buses from the designated pick up point at the international terminal. Had to wait an hour to get a bus to the domestic terminal, to get a bus to the hotel. Wish I had just got a taxi! Took 2 and half hours from when the plane landed to get to the 'onsite' hotel...be warned!!",3
Airport,If you can get TSA pre check then I would recommend that. If not...may an early arrival time and patience be with you.,3
Airport,Get there early if you're flying at night. Precheck closes at 9. 30 minute wait at security.,3
Airport,Not nearly enough seating or power outlets...,3
Airport,As far as airports go this place has a lot except for security.   Takes for ever.  Unlike other large airports they still don't know how to get people thru the lines,3
Airport,Very very crowded at 5AM!  WOW!!!,3
Airport,"It's your average airport...allow (a long) time for clearing border control, especially if transiting between flights!",3
Airport,Big and crowded.  Not enough TSA's. Long lines at security.,3
Airport,Good had a 13 hr delay there people was friendly,3
Airport,Its getting busy though At rush hours. Get yourself extra time for checking in and get to the gates.,3
Airport,"Sheeeesssshhhh!! Huge As Hell!!! Had to take the train!! Needs more rails, poles, bars I'm Heafty!! I'm HEAVY on my own arms!! Train making me exercise, throwing me round!! Lol....Smh!! Lol...",3
Airport,Dropped people off at the airport.,3
Airport,Great airport. Very efficient. The international terminal (F) needs more restaurants. The food selection is horrible.,3
Airport,"The planes fly in. The planes fly out. McDonald's on concourse A is card only for payment. The hash browns were soggy/oily, more so than usual. The coffee was good. The sausage egg McMuffin was just right. Price was cheaper than back home.",3
Airport,Mid-day layover. Food choices not great. Prices inflated as always. But nice waitstaff.,3
Airport,They like to keep the line moving. Felt like your being rushed.,3
Airport,Huge airport with under staffed and overwhelmed TSA. Even with precheck lines are still long,3
Airport,Loooong lines everywhere.  25 min wait to get a coffee.. no matter where. If you happen to get a place to eat.. food is atrociously bad. Very crowded no matter where you go in the airport. Power outlets at most seats.Airline staff depends on which airline. Transportation between terminals is very good.,3
Airport,Make sure to order starbucks on the app to skip the line,3
Airport,It was a decent airport. The rental car return was a bit confusing but ultimately easy to use.,3
Airport,So busy so late I can't believe how many people were there at 12:30 AM people are deffinatly getting back to traveling,3
Airport,Use parking from the shuttle if possible....I just spent $95 to park daily at the airport for 4 days.,3
Airport,"Crowded, but well organized. It's a shame they removed the smoking rooms. Those were a huge relief to those of us who are addicted to nicotine!",3
Airport,Flown through here many times. Everything you will be waiting for your bags for at LEAST 45 minutes.,3
Airport,"Location was great. United Airlines is awful service, even luggage got mistreated.",3
Airport,"This one giant airport.  We arrived in concourse A and our connection was in concourse D.  If it wasn't for the train, I really doubt we would have have made the connection.  We were here early in the day and not a lot of food places were open.",3
Airport,Rental car centre drop off is great! Commute to international Airport is incredibly slow,3
Airport,"one of the perks of living in atl is the airport!

Airport,"I haven't been here since 2019, prior pandemic. However, it was not a long wait to get checked in. My advice, arrive early, so not to deal with the pedestrian traffic once inside the airport. I also tried this new thing call ""Clear."" This is suppose to help eliminate standing on long lines at TSA. So far, it was a good entry. Safe travels to all.",3
Airport,Very busy and crowded but the lines moved fast.,3
Airport,Typical big airport. Delta flights was in 2 different terminals that sucked. Delta offered my wife and I $600 to change flights.  The offer was given on a first come first served basis but the hag supervisor gave it to someone else.  I will be avoiding Delta in the future and the bad thing about that is I plan to travel twice 2 Atlanta and once to Miami in the next year,3
Airport,The biggest issue I have is that you walk in what seems like a maze to get to TSA. Also the TSA lines are very long. Otherwise it's an airport.,3

Airport,"This airport is a beast to tackle. It‚Äôs so busy with thousands of people moving that it can feel overwhelming. The subways they have below that transfer you between terminals are quick and effective.

The airport is pretty old overall and could use more renovation to bring it up to standard with most other domestic airports in the US.",3
Airport,TSA AL linevery long. Very slow.  No fast food. Otherwise ok.,3
Airport,I was making a connection through Atlanta. This is one of the busiest airports and it shows. Everything is filthy and can really benefit from a deep clean. The ladies bathrooms lines are long too. Plan to be patient and wait.,3

Airport,Well I‚Äôm happy that you‚Äôre the busiest airport. The TSA check-in process at O‚ÄôHare is MUCH more efficient!,3
Airport,This is a busy airport..please allow enough hours before your flight to find parking and wait times for security checkpoints. Please look on tsa website for items that are allowed and aren't allowed in both carry-ons and checked bags.,3

Airport,"Clean and nice .. lol lot of walking ..
If you plan to buy food .. just remember .. under staffed and over worked .. get ready for some attitude.... Ugh üò©",3
Airport,Nice airport but way too busy for me.,3
Airport,"Everything seemed clean and efficient.  My only real complaint is how the luggage is handled.  There is a steep slide with a hard drop as the baggage goes onto the conveyor belt to be picked up.  The impact was enough to crack open the bottom of my hardshell suitcase, and it now has to be replaced.  Be careful if your luggage is the least bit fragile.",3
Airport,Poor signage.  Luggage came out extremely late. Bad encounter with staff when trying to ask directions to rental car area.,3
Airport,Not my favorite airport experience.  Access to food and coffee in the early am seems to limited Starbucks.,3
Airport,"Service was a little slow, under staffed. Food was good and beer was cold.",3
Airport,The non-parking garage parking is not awesome and almost made me nervous to get to my car in the middle of the night. It‚Äôs poorly lit and I saw no attendant or patrols. The airport itself was fine.,3
Airport,People is rude except one person that work security he really helped me. If it wasn't for him I would've missed my flight or been late. It's a lady that has a real attitude problem she needs a vacation or get laid.,3
Airport,Very few restaurants open.   Few food selections.  Service was good and employees friendly at Atlanta Bread Company in terminal C.,3
Airport,Security was surprisingly slow and packed on a Sunday night. But they had a lot of lanes open and everyone was friendly.,3

Airport,Small...

I mostly fly southwest but I go on other carriers as well. Can't get lost here... ¬†In and out in no times... I would give five stars if we had more direct flights... Thats all..,3

Airport,"East airport especially with TSA precheck, but just not much going on in the way of restaurants or spaces to relax or kill time. They no longer have the American lounge here, and only 1 real restaurant outside of McDonald's or dunkin. I know you can't really complain about an airport but still not as ideal as many others!",3

Airport,Layover before heading back to Virginia,3
Airport,Rain happens. Flights get delayed. We made it in the end.,3
Airport,Many of the attractions and rides where not in operation. It was kind of a waste of time and money. The rides we did get to go on were fun. Not the best place for tiny children and the food and drink prices are ridiculous.,3
Airport,"I hate the fact that I got padded down, but I guess they are doing there job.",3
Airport,"Not near enough Delta agents for a Delta hub.  Not enough arrival/departure boards with the terminals.  Rental car setup was great.  Stores and restaurants were shut down at 8pm, lowering choices people had and increasing waits.  Most of this is staffing problems.",3

Airport,"Fantastic airport, but has a rental car shuttle so it will never be good, unfortunately. You spend more time shuttling then you do to go through security and board the plane.",3

Airport,"Very busy place, pick up can be a bit dangerous for the passengers",3

Airport,I left my carry-on bag in the airport before I went thru Security. What can I do? Please assist.,3
Airport,"Offsite rental cars (hate that),  not an extremely large airport so the lines aren't too long. Picking up your baggage requires patience",3
Airport,A very busy airport. You want to arrive there some hours before your flight.,3
Airport,"A beautiful airport but the signage is not well designed, not easy to go to your connection.",3
Airport,4 stars because the sockets used to plug in items do not work on any that I've tried. So I went to ticket agent to ask to use their wall socket. Gate D21 and surrounding area,3

Airport,It was quite less crowded still busy but without the big city defiance rudeness .... didn't spend much time here but maybe next time ...,3
Airport,If you are there with no restaurants the beverage machines were broke in terminalcone fyi...other than this..nice place,3
Airport,Security was very rude and impassioned when I have an 11yr old son the rest of the workers were very polite,3
Airport,"Very little in the way of breakfast opportunities.  It was 8:30 in the morning, there was a Smashburger open and a Chick-fil-a next to it that was closed.  Not overly impressed with the Minneapolis-St Paul Airport.",3
Airport,"Terminals are good.
Only having one departure runway today is NOT GOOD.  One hour on the plane so far for 2 3/3 hrs flight, and still in line for takeoff.",3
Airport,Not many good options to eat while waiting for a flight. Food was overpriced. Men's bathroom was good but wife said the women's room had a stench and desperately needed cleaning.,3
Airport,"We got here early. Plenty of places for food. Only complaint was our flight was delayed by two hours,  even though not the airports fault.",3
Airport,Good place to watch aircraft land and take off. Wait for a delayed flight üõ´,3
Airport,"Date of Visit: 6/2/2022 - Typical airport experience, didn't seem any better or worse than any other airport.",3
Airport,Baggage claim area is under massive construction. One elevator bank down to ground transportation. The airport has definitely seen better days. Hopefully that construction gets wrapped up quickly.,3
Airport,"Only giving a 3 because I literally had to run through it to get to my connecting flight so I didn't really have much time to spend in it.   Seemed fairly nice, orderly and clean.",3
Airport,With few planes coming in at night I have no idea why they need to park you at the farthest gate and then not tell you which carousel your luggage is at.   Well I do...they think if you have to walk a long way it gives them more time to get your baggage inand you won't notice the wait as much.,3
Airport,They could improve the signage when picking someone up from main terminal.it took me 45 minutes to get from the highway to pick up my son because people were changing lanes trying to get in the lane for their airline.  Lanes should be marked closer to where people enter so they aren't changing lanes at the last minute,3
Airport,Major negative when ALL the service businesses are closed at 9pm or earlier.  You are a hub airport.,3
Airport,"Delta Airlines Gate Taking a flight today to Chicago, Illinois.",3
Airport,Landed in Airport this morning after leaving the Airport at DFW,3
Airport,Huge airport. Many places still closed. Lots of different places to sit.,3
Airport,It was simple but yet still confusing in a way,3
Airport,New place. Seems overwhelmed. Nice staff. Dosa was not a disappointment and delivered fresh. Too many items. My suggestion would be reduce your menu and maintain quality. Place looks run down. No new restaurant feeling.,3
Airport,"Lots of traffic when you pick up some one.
Cellphone lot close to the terminal.",3
Airport,Pretty good airport if you don't fly in in a Sunday since so much was closed,3
Airport,"The help people and all workers were nice and all but I was stuck there for 2 days due to cancellation and full flights, Delta I hope to see better next time..",3
Airport,"Clean airport with friendly staff but limited food options - unless you want simple dishes like burgers and sandwiches or sweet stuff.
The staff at the airport are friendly, but the restaurant staff in the two restaurants we visited were less so. Nonetheless MSP has a nice, small size which makes it less stressful to pass through. We‚Äôre bound to be back because we have no choice.",3
Airport,It's to Far!!!!  Flight came in on South West end and connecting flight on the North East side!  Barly made the connection....,3

Theme Park,Fun experience but VERY pricey! From a bottle of water in the park to dinner choices at the resort restaurant everything is way overpriced.,3
Aquarium,Packed but worth it!  But the information desk needs to know where the changing stations are so guide a parent quickly.,3
Theme Park,"Flower beds were overgrown, bathrooms stunk of urine. My family however did enjoy the rides. Just felt park was not how it was.",3
Theme Park,We spent the day and still didn't see everything. If it weren't so expensive I would go more often.,3
Theme Park,"Fireworks and laser show was good, but the paid seats were a waste.  Coca-cola product is just a lemonade or a water - no coca-cola - and the popcorn was cold and burnt.

I recommend sitting in the lawn instead.",3
AZM,Zoo was big but lots of closed exhibits. Splash pad is always fun but packed. Skip the long line and buy your tickets online.,3
Aquarium,Underwhelming but given the space and area it is what it is. Good ice cream though,3
Zoo,Zoo and Aquarium were clean and the grounds are lovely. One of the aquariums were closed and there were only a few animals out. I think it would be more worth the trip when more exhibits are open.,3
Theme Park,"It says online and on a brochure closes at 9pm Saturday but they don't. They closed at 7pm. My kids wasn't happy about it, we had planned the day till 9pm.",3
Aquarium,Over priced and can't bring in your own food. Cafe prices are insane. Can do the whole aquarium in an hour and a half.,3
Theme Park,It was soooo hot and humid making it unbearable.  Walking up and down hills especially from the parking areas was brutal.  Need more shade in parking areas. Trees would be great.,3
Museum,"It was all outstanding and educational except for the tram'süò¢The trams seemed to be unorganized.  People stood in lines for for lengthy periods inside, then ushered outside in the heat for a lengthy time . Finally the tram came  and  took us to our destination to see the Apollo 13 rocket,",3
Aquarium,The aquarium itself is great. My only gripe is nobody is enforcing the kids play area by the penguins ( there is a height limit ) so you have teenagers running full speed at my 2 year old pretending to stab people.,3
Theme Park,"Beautiful property and there is a lot to see and due. However, I felt that I was getting nickeled and dimed to death. And to go see a laser show, $20 per person, I skipped the event.",3
Zoo,Most of the exhibits were empty. We 100% understand the birds being put away due to the bird flu. I get it. But when 40% or more of the exhibits are empty‚Ä¶. You feel ripped off. The animals we did see were beautiful.,3
Zoo,I wasn't too thrilled being that a lot of the animal enclosures were closed either due to Avian Flu or because of various other reasons. Maybe a future visit will receive a better rating.,3
Theme Park,Not enough  handicapped friendly rides. The asphalt is so dark it attracts the sun and makes for miserable time. Had it been cooler it would've been nice. We just went at wrong time of year,3
Airport,I loved the airport but I‚Äôm shocked that an electronic vendor Inmotion Entertainment was playing explicit music loudly as folks walked by with their kids. Arbys served us stake food. Do not think that food service is good after 11:00 pm.,3
Museum,"It was ok. ¬†Some figures were SPOT ON and others were WAY OFF!! Beyonc√©, Ariana Grande and Paul Walker were the worst!!! Also if you didn't already know Dollys boobs aren't all the way real",3
AZM,Okok but the price is steep compare to the value it gives,3
Airport,"Great amenities, I must be in concourse A, although the design causes some odd bottlenecks. Really happy to see sustainability plans in the works. However, for how clean some of the design is, the gate area and bathrooms were a mess. They need to deep clean and keep clean like the lives and passengers depend on it.",3
Airport,"Went to McDonald's because virtually nothing was open due to COVID-19, and waited over 45 minutes for our food. Had to board our plane without receiving out food. Paid for nothing. However, if you just avoid McDonald's the airport itself is in my top 5 favorite airports in the world.",3
Airport,"Nothing really spectacular from the road. Inside is an absolute mess. The worlds longest lines form miles ahead of the security check point. Very badly mismanaged. Please please please show up early. There's no forgiveness or understanding. Finally snakes our way through and into the airport, clean bathrooms, nice big spaces, lots of shopping, and some food options.",3
Airport,"Stopped in for lunch and ordered the Blucy with tots. Service was good, but the burger was average at best. Other items on their menu may be better, but they were pushing this burger pretty hard. It was cooked fine, just average taste. May want to update your burger to keep up with McDonald's quarter pounder.",3
Airport,"We only changed planes here. ¬†Don't underestimate the amount of time it will take or the distance you will have to walk at this airport. ¬†We had a Delta connection and I swear we must have walked at least a half a mile. ¬†Otherwise, the airport was fine. ¬†Still lots of closures due to COVID.",3
Airport,I don't know why this airport is rated good. To me it was average. I landed here for transit around 8 am. All dinner options are closed except for Panda Express. Restrooms are not big either; average too.,3
Airport,Much much bigger airport than I expected. Why is it you always come in one the exact opposite side of the airport you fly out of. Took the tram and still had a treck to our gate. Lots of places to eat and buy junk.,3
Airport,Easy to get in and out and is a pretty busy airport. Lots of food and shopping options while you wait. Employees keep the terminals pretty clean.Signage could be better as it can be confusing to figure out where to pick up Uber etc.. Also a challenge at check in with the lines - they need better traffic control when lines are long.,3
Museum,"Blah
Lame and boring.. Employees were nice and energetic.. wish there were more to see than fancy kiosks..  How abt Centrifuge, water training, something more intriguing than flight suits etc..",3
AZM,There was some very cool exhibits and fish. But it was real pricey and didn't take but about an hour. I had 2 14 yr old boys so we went thru kinda fast. But maybe kids under 10 would have a better and take longer to get thru it.,3
AZM,Need to keep small children out of pool when the waves are turned on.  Need water and or soda access at the main pool as their are aways off from the main wave pool.,3
Aquarium,"It was too crowded, they used to do certain ppl in at certain times of the day. By appointment, but now it seems like they are letting everyone in no matter when your appointment was.",3

Theme Park,"Park is over priced. We were there last week and most of the rides had one cart/train running. With this hefty price,  there should be enough staff to alleviate guests waiting. Time Traveler the best run ride and a ride like no other.",3
Theme Park,Too much change. A charge of $10.00 a person to sit on the lawn.,3
Airport,It was not easy finding food options. I had to settle for a pre-made sandwich and the lettuce had black spots on it. Also the bread was soggy. I liked the automatic walk ways. But didn't see plugs for my phone.,3
Museum,Outrageously over priced. The outside of the building is the most interesting part and you don't even have to pay for it.,3
Museum,Got to see the man in black today at the Hollywood Wax Museum Entertainment Center #johnnycash #tennessee #countrymusic,3
Theme Park,It's nice but it's getting to expensive u charge for parking then u have to pay to sit on the lawn to watch the show,3
Museum,Higher price thought would be more. But interesting visit.,3
Attraction,"Food is too expensive, but tasty for theme park food. Tired of seeing ""understaffed"" the people didn't go anywhere. Just pay the workers a livable wage and you will have the people to keep all rides open",3
Airport,"Melody is only spending two hours in the ATL airport, but wanted to be sure to try a Georgia beer while she was here! The Three Taverns Saporous sour is exactly what she needed to get her through her layover üç∫‚úàÔ∏è",3
Museum,Adult cost isn't bad but almost $25.00 for kids 4 to 11 is pretty high. A 4 year old paying almost as much as an adult doesn't make much sense.,3
Museum,So crowded you almost can't do anything. The wait times for the ropes course and the ride are so long it's not even worth it.,3
Theme Park,"Very expensive, nice place, we did it in 4 hours. Way too much $$ to get into park, and only take 4 hours to do the whole place, food very expensive as well.",3
Aquarium,The hippo exhibit was neat but the rest was underwhelming. Not a bad experience. Just wasn't great.,3
Airport,"Airport was okay,  Southwest flight not so much. Many delays.",3
Airport,Very busy airport. You better pack your patience.,3
Aquarium,"The exhibits were great, and the sections were well thought out. It was overly crowded and difficult to see certain exhibits.",3
Museum,"This is a true tourist spot.  The wax figures don't resemble the intended person.  It's laughable!  That service, however is great.  Very friendly staff.",3
Aquarium,"It was very nice to see the animals,  only problem is there were to many people pushing my baby stroller around and almost falling onto my daughter.",3
Airport,Could not get a milk share in terminal c,3
Museum,"There are a few cool activities there but unless you are a local, it is very expensive for what it is.  My kids liked the bubble area the best.",3
Zoo,"The place looks like it's falling apart and every time I go, multiple habitats are closed. One portion of the aquarium was nice though, the other closed..",3
Airport,Flight delayed. Not airport's fault.,3
Zoo,Food options can be worked upon and the direction signs needs to be upgraded / increased to not feel lost at times.,3
Airport,It's a small airport but improvements can be done.,3
Museum,"Expected more,some statues do look like the person being represented,others not so much.",3
Airport,"8hrs spent here...was ok. Would be nice not to have those metal arm rest though
.",3
AZM,"The lines were so long, I‚Äôve never seen the zoo like this. Especially on a rainy day. We saw one animal and left. It was too much.",3
Garden,Now thru July 24th Callaway Gardens y'all! Get those tickets now!,3
AZM,It's okayish. The statues are accurate but there are not a lot of them. The place seems to be a bit overrated.,3
Museum,"The arcade is the best part! Definitely wasn't what I expected otherwise. The line was long to get in, & it was pricey. Don't think I'll go back.",3
Theme Park,They need more challenging rides.. not only children love Legos and some like wilder rides.  I still had fun tho.,3
Airport,I went to swissport not the actual airport,3
AZM,As of 7/14/22 it's $45 adult ticket . Food and drinks are Way too much bring your own.,3
Theme Park,Really could use more attractions and shaded areas.,3
Museum,"Wasn‚Äôt super cool, some of the wax figures were unrecognizable without the little names next to them. I‚Äôd rather of went hiking or out to eat then of bought these tickets.",3
Museum,They have a few celebrity wax figures here. For the price you would expect it to be a larger exhibit. Go to the Aquarium at the Boardwalk before the Hollywood Wax museum to get a better discount on package tickets.,3
Airport,Busy busy away so make sure you get there at least 2hr ahead of time.,3
Museum,If it wasn't for the Mirror Maze and Outbreak attractions it would be 4 stars.  Many of the wax figures do not look anything like the celebrity.,3
AZM,One day is not enough because the child will not move even though it is large enough to turn in one day.,3

AZM,"The parking lot is too far away The food is disappointing It was nice to have a fan on every ceiling when you line up It feels like you are in a fairy tale!!! There wasn&#39;t a lot of queues because of the success of the nudge game, but the driving school staff were really friendly.",3
AZM,"Good aquarium and have maintained fairly, good to take small children to view fishes. 4d cinema is also OK. Better to book ticket online. Would be good if they upgrde the facility to make it more attractive.
If you have visited this 2 years back then nothing much has changed in this place.",3
AZM,The park was great but when I paid $15 dollars for saugy fries and and a burger that had been sitting under a warmer for who knows how long yeah a little ridiculous.,3
Museum,"Rates are expensive and basically force you to buy all access passes. PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR RECEIPT. I had a discount for 5+ people that WASN'T applied at checkout. Because of the huge lines and short staffed, it was impossible to rectify.

Enjoyable visit otherwise.",3
Museum,"Mid experience. Clothing only went to a XXL. Food was sub par. Tour of the, whatvi would call the junkyard, was neat. Nice to see the little kids faces light up while they stare at the rockets.",3
Aquarium,"Better to go if you have kids, generally speaking. Makes for a good day adventure.",3
Aquarium,"Loved it, but very few people with masks in a VERY crowded environment, and now I have Covid...not worth while masks not being worn.",3
Water park,"A step above an aquatic center (so save your money), however if you do go make sure you wear water shoes/flip flops when walking between rides the cement is extremely hot, as they don't have enough shade and misters to cool the concrete.",3
AZM,It was okay.... i wouldn't pay for it again. Most tanks have the same fish. Jellyfish room was really cool. The exterior of the building is honestly the best part.... my personal opinion of course.,3
Museum,"The museum itself is outstanding. However there is an additional charge for the Egypt exhibit, and it is poorly executed seeming to be a money grab.",3
Zoo,"They had a bunch of closed exhibits when I visited. It was kind of disappointing, but I was satisfied that they had plenty of wheel chairs accessible paths and wheelchairs for rent it was only a extra $10 or if you want a electric one they have them for rent as well for $30",3
AZM,"There&#39;s no shade, so it&#39;s hard in the summer...",3
Theme Park,Love the park and laser show but really disappointed at village around train station a lot of places closed. BBQ restaurant and one next to it closed only place was burgers at train depot open and they didn‚Äôt seem to organized. Went to hotel across the street and it was closed as well.,3
Zoo,Hopefully soon everything will be open and available inside again.,3
Airport,"A typical airport with two terminals, with apparently mundane spatial coordination, billing a rail ''message'' between the place of arrival and the space for check-in and pastime",3
AZM,Seems like everytime I go there are barely any animals out anymore! I've been 3x this yr and have left within an hour of arriving because empty enclosures!,3
Theme Park,"They  open at 9:30, if they opened at 8:00 or 8:30 am even, would help it not be so hot, food is very high,  you can bring your own food and drink,  you have to be searched at front gate anyway",3
Water park,A little small for the price. Overall fun but not worth the price.,3
Airport,The only problem is it's so crowded it's hard to get anywhere and it doesn't seem very disability safe,3
AZM,"Kentucky Kingdom to get new front gate, drop-off area and a merged parking lot! There could also be new hotels added to the area as well! This would be great for Kentucky Kingdom!

Museum,Some people don't feel comfortable with their weight displayed in public. Maybe rethink the way people are weighed. There we quite a few things that could have been fun that were not open and/or broken. It was fun though.,3
Airport,I'm not gonna lie. I was scared as hell of this airport but it's well ran and the customer service is exceptional.,3
Theme Park,"Most of the trip was alright, not sure if it matches their price. Be warned there are weight and diameter requirements NOT listed on the website for certain rides.",3
Theme Park,"Line wait time was too long and rides time was too short. Ninjago ride needs some improvement. It was confusing and you couldn't tell if you are actually shooting, only the score kept ticking.",3
Theme Park,"Stupid expensive.  $15 for parking, family of 4 will pay $190, for one day.  Use to be a 2 day pass.  Don't get me started on the food.",3
Theme Park,"Longest ride was the front gate. Could not pay for parking with cash. Only a handful of rides. The cost for entry was ok, but I would have expected the water park to be included in the entry fee. Florida in the summer is really hot. Plan on sweating all day.",3
AZM,Hot! Bring water and a hat! Park is clean and well maintained,3
Theme Park,It was a good time for the most part. A little difficult to navigate tho .,3
Airport,Meh. It‚Äôs still Atlanta. If you are well traveled you understand.,3
AZM,Only problem is everything in it shuts down by like 3:30 even though its open till 5,3
Attraction,"Clean, reasonable lines for July.
The area where the Lego buildings are needs some major updating. Many of the mechanicals were not working. Most of the colors were very sunfaded.",3
Theme Park,Fun day for the kiddos. Super pricey to get in for what they have though...,3
Museum,2nd time I went in 7 years. It's just not that interesting... And the weird thing is I enjoy space... Hopefully they'll improve some of these exhibits and the tram tour.,3
Aquarium,"It was an alright experience, a one and done for me. Best attraction was the Sea Lion show and seeing the Whale Shark. Nothing too special here at all.",3
Airport,"Signs are everywhere but baggage claim is at least 500 miles away! Take the tram to your bags!!!! Don‚Äôt walk it! Also, if you‚Äôre getting a rental car, take the sky train to the check in counters and then go to the parking garage. Pheewwww, I‚Äôm exhausted!",3
Museum,Bring your adventurous spirit and closed toe shoes.,3
Airport,A liitle confusing. Many terminals. I saw one guy left one terminal to walk to another to go through TSA again?  I had little trouble. Ran into old friend. Small world. I am from Oregon,3
Airport,Pre-security queue in the international concourse (F) seen from an internal observation window at The Club ATL Priority Pass lounge.,3
Theme Park,So much walking. So much climbing. Rides that fit 12 people w 1 attendant so even short lines have long waits. Worse than average amusement park food. Flat soda in the refill areas. Not sure I'd go again.,3
Aquarium,Lots of fishes to be seen but the price seems too expensive for the services provided.,3
AZM,want to improve add something new Create more activities How many times have you gone?,3
Theme Park,The kids loved it. The bad part is they only running one tram. It's hot and it's many trams just sitting. As a adult I do not like standing around waiting when it could be more efficient.,3
Water park,"It's more for younger kids. My teenagers loved a couple slides, but wanted to go back to Silver Dollar City because they had better water rides there",3
AZM,Some animals out.  But allot not.. disappointing for that,3
Attraction,It was hot and the kids were getting grumpy so we spent most of the day at the water park and the lines were pretty long,3
Water park,It was fun. Disappointing compared to regular Dollywood. Not near enough to do for the price tag.,3
AZM,It was very nice and clean. A lot of different areas for the kids to explore. I really liked the petting part at the end. It's very small and not really worth the price you pay to get in. I would have also loved more signs telling you about the different fish.,3
Museum,"Upside down house is a bit of a stretch, cool on the outside but mostly just a fun house inside. Lots of activities for kids, very busy, a bit too expensive.",3
Aquarium,"My girlfriend likes it, but don&#39;t you have to notify me in advance that there will be a cost to take pictures or not?",3
AZM,"Good interactive parts for kids
This is a great place if you have kids.  It had some good interactive parts and the tanks were nice.   I little pricey for a couple of seniors and thus the three stars",3
Aquarium,"shedd_aquarium using the citypass #chicago

Airport,"Nice airport, under construction. BUT, why are the security check lanes always over an hour? And why does the TSA wait time always show 15-20 min? Ugh.",3
Attraction,"Not meant for kids probably more than 8. The water park was fun, the theme park was a let down.",3
Museum,Not much to see on the tours. Did the blue and white tours. Was disappointed in the Mission Control Room tour. Souvenir store had long lines because only 2 registers were open. Film in the big theater was good. We left without see most exhibits because it was so crowded.,3
Museum,I wish they would start using BCE/CE vs the old religious standard.,3
Theme Park,I suggest early Fall or Late Spring. It was very hot.,3
Airport,Could have been a 5 but the food was VERY expensive.  No need to charge outrageous prices just because you have a captive audience.  Probably the same at all airports but this was the first time we needed to eat a meal because of the length of the trip.,3
Airport,"Busy airport. Working just fine, but the security check should have more personnel and the signage could be more informative",3
AZM,First time visit wasn't a good first impression. My kids loved it even though half the park was shut down and the food is ridiculously expensive. Not sure if we will return.,3
AZM,"Day trip to the living desert üåµ

#palmsprings #livingdesert #nature #photography #california #desert #travel",3
Theme Park,"Good place for kids. Not too big: 1 day may be enough to experience every major rides (when people are not crowded). Food is too expensive, especially drinks.",3
Aquarium,There is much less to see than in the past. There are a lot of experience zones that have clothes on display and don&#39;t know what the concept is.,3
Airport,Not a review on the airport as much as the people. Don't walk through the wet floor sign as the janitor is cleaning. Janitor spent an extra 30 minutes just mopping up the prints made from people walking through.,3
AZM,You can go for children to study fish species. The entrance fee is 650 baht,3
Water park,"Small water park
It's a great water park if you like small parks. We are used to Wisconsin Dells so the rides were small to us and not enough of them. We spent all of our time in the wave pool. The concrete gets very hot, so make sure you wear water shoes",3
Theme Park,"The park was fun.  The cost of the hotel should have made it a 5 star resort and it did not measure up.  Paper thin walls . Thermostat was not adjustable.
Recommend the park but not the hotel .",3
Theme Park,Most of the restaurants inside the park are closed. No Shade. Too much walking between the parks...,3
Airport,Everything food related was closed begore 10 PM. Lots of travelers left withput dinner options.,3
Theme Park,Nothing started at proper time but it was still fun,3
Airport,"All stores are closed 1 AM- 5 AM so if you have flight early morning, be prepared. Also they make inside like a chiller dont know why but you can barely handle it even with beanie and jacket in July!",3
AZM,It&#39;s still a bit lacking About 2% I feel like the age is too low I hope it develops gradually The hotel was good~,3
AZM,"Good rides, lines move very slowly probably a lack of help.",3
Airport,Winter may be challenging but I would move there.,3
Airport,Busy as always. They need to check into arrival and departure concourses being closer. Barely made my next flight trying to get from D to A. Only had an hour layover.,3
Theme Park,"Got there late, and most shops, food and rides closed by 8PM even though they were open til 10 PM.",3
Airport,"Overall, a very clean, efficient layout with shuttle to different gates. E Gates don‚Äôt have much variety in duty free shops and some remain closed. The food hall is very overcrowded and the lounges are now quite restricted without membership",3
Theme Park,"Got lost here as a child, but still have gone back countless times and look forward to it every time as an adult.",3
Zoo,It's hard to get an organization this size perfect. A start would be more grants to ease all ancillary costs to guests. At times it felt like Disney world with $20 bills falling out of my pocket at every turn. Other zoos are getting this right.,3
Garden,Beautiful garden but very long lines at both eating establishments!  So frustrating that there is not vending machines or a quick grab and go option!! Should have brought snacks and a drink.....if I had known.,3
Museum,The Saturn 5 rocket was worth the admission. But besides that mostly disappointing.,3
Aquarium,"Okay so it‚Äôs cool because of all the attractions, but it‚Äôs really unorganized in main attractions people literally sit around and not move they need to have someone coordinating because it gets pack other than that it was nice",3
Aquarium,"More for families, less for couples. The shark tank is the best part. Avoid going on weekends due to big crowds. If you go on the weekend, book your tickets in advance and arrive prior to 1pm.",3
Airport,"The airport is nice and clean. I had to remove a whole star because there was nowhere to by a coffee at this airport when our plane landed at 11 pm. Sounds petty, but it was pretty frustrating to meü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",3
Theme Park,It was a good time with my family but walking was longer than having fun.,3
Theme Park,It wasn‚Äôt a bad Expres but we had too many issues with the rides while visiting. Hopefully more improvements comes along in the future.,3
Airport,Very busy as expected it's an airport,3
Aquarium,Too crowded. Dolphin show is boring. Everything else is ok.,3
Airport,Smaller airport so good for travel with little to no passengers. Food is very basic they try to be local but local food here is more expensive and time consuming when it comes to making. Employees at food locations are lazy and sometimes rude when they feel overwhelmed.,3
Theme Park,"The park is beautiful and I love it there. The Lasershow is why we visited most recently, and while the show was good, the fact that they now charge admission to the show that has been FREE since 1983 is extremely off-putting. The atmosphere was good anyway, and my kids had a good time.",3
Garden,"ü§ç  TODAY is the last day to get your discounted Callaway Gardens tickets!!!!
#callawaygardens",3
Theme Park,"Average - more kiddy place , for big kids 8+ not that fun. my little one enjoyed",3
Theme Park,We confirmed several times with the staff that we have early access (9:30) to the park as we are staying in the hotel. Now it‚Äôs raining and we are still stuck in the long queue for security check @ 9:50,3
Airport,"A good, modern airport with only one major drawback. Airport personnel do not keep vehicles moving fast enough in the departure or arrivals lanes. Cars sit waiting for arrivals in both sides without police making certain they continue moving after a few minutes, so traffic is often at a standstill during peak times.",3
Airport,It‚Äôs a huge airport. Directions are clear. There are trains between terminals and you can walk as well. Train frequency is a little erratic. Walking is best.,3
AZM,"Online booking, does not except intl cards so pay up full price!  It's ok but overpriced for what you get to see.",3
Theme Park,"Disappointed
Our trip to Stone Park was just OK.We arrived in the afternoon (4pm) and many attractions and shops were closed. We enjoyed the sky ride to the top of the mountain but the rest of the attractions included in our package of $35 per person were not worth the price.",3
Aquarium,(Translated by Google) You have to pay extra for a lot (Original) You have to pay extra for a lot,3
Theme Park,"We are Always having fun,but expensive and low quality food. bring your own food",3
Airport,We were just there too long waiting on a connection .,3
Zoo,"Spent almost 4 hrs. on Monday so no rush, nice options for lunch inside park, 4 parking levels with enough spots.",3
Theme Park,"Extremely long lines, very busy. Kiddos enjoyed themselves",3
Airport,One of the Busiest airports I've been thru. However the staff is kind and courteous.  Night and evening are the worst.  Traveling in the morning thru here is ideal.,3
Theme Park,Did everything in a day. Not enough big n tall rides.,3
Theme Park,"Beautiful, but overpriced parking. $20??? That‚Äôs how much I pay to get into Universal studios for the day with two theme parks, shopping, restaurants in Orlando.",3
Museum,It was ok but they need to add updated stars two years I've gone and it's been the same people too pricey for the repeat,3
AZM,"Took my princess to the zoo today. It was HOT, so we finished the trip with Rita‚Äôs!",3
Theme Park,"No vegan food but good time
They didn't have vegan options so my wife ended up feeling unwell the next day from eating food she isn't accustomed to anymore. Otherwise it's a good time",3
AZM,"You can have breakfast with elephants at ZooTampa at Lowry Park this summer, the elephant also paints.",3
AZM,It was so hot the animals didn't even want to come out but got a shot of the ones that did,3
Museum,Lots of exhibits were not working.  Fairly crowded but I expected that .,3
Museum,"Cool concept, kinda pricey. Many of the attractions were not working.  Then a lot of add ons.",3
Aquarium,Okay aquarium.  I've seen better.   The oceanarium is nice.   Laid out a little oddly.,3
Aquarium,"It is also needed for New Life Spa in Da Nang, Vietnam.",3
Water park,"small waterpark, not much exciting. limited food options",3
Airport,"The airport staff was excellent, but the bathrooms were terrible...not clean.",3
Zoo,Kinda disappointing. Alot of the exhibits are closed right now. But it's a fun walk around. And not that expensive for a zoo.,3
AZM,"The number of animals and their care with well adapted environments. The charisma entrance, they do not accept cards and they try to sneak things in. Beware of them, very bad",3
Aquarium,Great exhibits but the parking and gift shop are way overpriced.,3

Airport,"This airport is easy to figure out and follow but dang, the smell of jet fuel exhaust at the arrivals area in terminal 1 is giving me a headache! Fix your air system. This can‚Äôt be healthy.",3
Zoo,"Amazing zoo, I could hang out there for days, but it's so heartbreaking to see that miserable Asian elephant. They need to bring that poor thing to a sanctuary somewhere.",3
Theme Park,"We had an okay time, not great.  As far as theme parks go, it's no where near the best.
Once was enough!!",3
Theme Park,"Grew up going here in the 90's and always loved it.  Now with $20 parking and $35+ admission, you still have to pay $5 or more to see the laser show.  Admission should include everything.",3
Attraction,"It was an ok visit
Enjoyed the New Legoland World. Only downside, the lines were to long. We waited in  line for the carousel from 45min to 50min, just so the ride could be 2mins long. Also the staff worked at a slow pace  disengaged with the guest.",3
Airport,It was crowded for a Thu evening flight. There are few food places that were open.,3
Attraction,"Watch out for bees
Warning: I got bit by a bee so watch out since they migrate around the trash cans. Some really great rides and really nice staff.",3
Airport,This airport could really use some work stations by the gates for people that are traveling for work and want to optimize their time.,3
Attraction,"Long wait times
Kids enjoyed the water park. The wait time for the rides were to long.every ride was minimum 40 minutes long.  I wanted to the lazy river but it was closed that day we visited.",3
Aquarium,"Many sharks, 2 big hippos & penguins are the highlights for us. Quite expensive",3
AZM,"So of course we went from 11am-230pm, the animals were hot and laying in the shade and very hard to see. We weren't impressed. Homosassa zoo was much better",3
Museum,PRICY!!! Be ready to run out of things to do in a couple of hours. Not worth the $30 you'll have to pay to go in.,3
Zoo,"Very expensive for a small zoo without a lot of animals!

Three exhibits are currently closed: Puffins, Polar Bears and South Pacific Aquarium.

If you are short on time go to Pt Definace otherwise head to a Woodland Park Zoo!",3
Aquarium,Loved the aquarium but the place was packed! Difficult to walk around with children and a stroller. The timed ticketing is a joke!,3
AZM,"Very over priced!!! NO  large Ocean life.
The only think that was cool was the jellyfish room and the stingrays petting room.",3
Museum,To many  people and most of them aren‚Äôt following the whole 6 feet apart thing,3
Aquarium,Very crowed. Going up to the dolphin show are 2 escalators & an elevator but coming down there's only 1 set of steps coming down. Way too many people trying to get down.,3
Aquarium,"It was ok,  but nothing I'd want to honestly go back for",3
Aquarium,They are still using Covid regulations. So be prepared to make reservations!,3
Theme Park,Love going to Dollywood but went today on my motorcycle and they don't have any parking spaces upfront now for them like they used to.,3
AZM,"It‚Äôs a really pretty aquarium, but not worth the cost, in my opinion.",3
Airport,"Not a bad airport. If they had more clear signs getting you to the baggage claim and fewer signs telling you what a great airport they are, I'd be happier.",3
AZM,"Clean and small , not a lot of parking,  animal pens could be better and bigger,  plants and flowers are nice but Columbus zoo is better..",3
Attraction,The rides were fun but considering how long the lines were it's not worth the price....you don't have enough time to really get your money's worth imho.,3
Aquarium,"Day trips to the shedd_aquarium where I only take 5 pictures, and they‚Äôre all of the same Paddlefish ü•∞",3
Theme Park,"I expected much more.... :-(
Best for kids under 10.
Not so many places to play with lego bricks.
The lego store has the same prices with the on line store",3
Theme Park,"I didn't do much here except go to the laser show which I enjoyed. It's a well kept, clean place.",3
Airport,Airport is usually pretty fast but the tsa workers weren‚Äôt the brightest,3
Zoo,"Lots of exhibits are closed (July 2022), and the layout isn't super great. It is clean and the animals that are there do appear well taken care of, but overall expected more animals, better flow, and more hands on activities from such a well-regarded zoo.",3
AZM,"If you haven‚Äôt seen a big Aquarium, or if it‚Äôs your first, it‚Äôs alright. Definitely not worth clearing your schedule for visiting otherwise.",3
Airport,Not as efficient an airport as I would like but Hartsfield deals with a heck of a lot of travelers. One suggestion...separate the passport holders from the rest...like Harry Reid does in Vegas. Makes for a smoother experience.,3
Aquarium,Sealife Busan Aquarium is located next to the white sand beach of Haeundae.,3
Airport,Wheelchair service never show up.. i almost miss my flight someone i told what happened  he took me toTSA and have ne to make the flight.. That's someone love what they do great customer service .,3
Museum,Wish there was more then 3 attractions.  We wasn't ready to go and the kiddos loved üíî it but was a little bit to pricey.....Prices needs to lower,3
Theme Park,"Beautiful theme park, but many attractions closed. In addition, the open roller coasters run only with one train despite a long wait. Kind of disappointing...",3
Aquarium,"Wish they had some bigger fish, but I guess it's good for the animals sake that they don't...",3
Museum,"Nice Museum
The Field Museum was nice. I felt it was nice, good; it wasn't very good. It felt old and dated. Nothing was outstanding. I felt the Levy ""Restaurant"" food prices were excessively high.",3
Museum,"Very pricey, Through the mirror Maze in less than 10 minutes.",3
Attraction,"Cool
Too many people in a small park.Too expensive (especially when you want to add waterpark : locker costs 16 dollars).Bricks are discolored by the sun.Star Wars Miniland is missing.",3
Theme Park,"hotel: nice however but no direct access to park for hotel guests, even though there could be a staircase to fix it! small pool for a resort.
park: not enough rides as of yet, excellent fireworks, avg guest services, shortage of utensils & only 4 working hand sanitizer station in the entire park.",3
Aquarium,"Took my son here, thought since it was a Monday it wouldn't be so crowded but it was PACKED! Definitely not worth the price when you can't hardly see the animals because of so many people.",3
Airport,Took my babies awhile but their home!,3
AZM,"Very nice place , educational, rip off for price. I stretched the walk thru into 45 minutes, could have completed it in less then 30 minutes. Greeters at the door seemed to have an attitude.",3
Aquarium,It was ok the price is not worth it if you have pay parking and at entrance say you get at discount that didn't work if you buy your entrance online,3
Airport,The 80s called and they want Terminal A back!,3
AZM,"We had fun but alot of the staff running the rides acted like they hated there job the staff made it feel unwelcoming. Alot of the rides were down

which was a little  upsetting",3
Airport,"I recommend however, the airport really needs to step up there game on international arrivals(probably domestic too). The 1st bathroom you reach in E concourse has been beyond disgusting the last 2 times I've been there in the last month.",3
Zoo,Alot of stuff is closed down alot of staff really don't know where stuff is at. A little disappointed in the zoo from the last time i was there. Colorado Springs zoo is a 1000% better,3
AZM,not pictured: the massive alligator we saw while golfing,3
Attraction,"Just ok
My little one enjoyed it but i really felt it was dirty especially the restrooms and we bought a souvenir allbtou can drink cup which the fill up yourself place where out of most sodas, out of ice, and flat. I was really disappointed overall with my experience",3
Theme Park,"Have loved it, lately though the lack of entertainment as before, and lack of rides opened,, and price to get in makes it not worth the pay.",3
Aquarium,"Nice aquarium but very small for the price. We would go to Shedd aquariumin Chigaco once or twice a week (their membership is worth it).
Here,  because of their size, we will probably not visit again.",3
AZM,The kids seemed to enjoy it somewhat. The facility was very clean.  It definitely wasn't worth the $140 for a family of 4.,3
AZM,It is a nice aquarium with a lot of neat fish but....it is very short. We walked through in 25 minutes. And stopped and looked at everything. The staff was a bit overbearing which made it not fun. We felt watched and just uncomfortable.,3
Zoo,"Mini vlog - Spending our family vacation in the pnw üå≤‚òÄÔ∏èüíï

üêíüêÖüêüüå≤‚òÄÔ∏è for our first day we went to Point defiance zoo & aquarium and had some cheeseburgers for dinner dicksdrivein",3
Museum,I think it‚Äôs time they update their culture displays and even the interactive booths. When you go to the health exhibit the avatars you select are not reflective of our population and the other culture exhibits have colonial stereotypes. I love how interactive it is but it‚Äôs 2022 come on!,3
AZM,"Small, not worth the price, however did have a military discount.",3
AZM,"Although the foliage was very beautiful, it just seems like the animals were lonely because some of them only had one animal on exhibit.",3
Aquarium,"Good place,  just doesn't change often enough,  I don't think we will renew the membership",3
Airport,Signage on the Sky Train for the International Terminal shuttle is difficult to find. The wait time for the shuttle is far too long. More shuttles should be added to the rotation. These two issues tainted an otherwise good experience.,3
Theme Park,"Was there 4 years ago and really enjoyed it.
Thos time,, I feel like the layout got changed a bit.
I would walk a mile just be a dead end. Prices went waaaay up and alot of things were closed. Didn't get my money's worth at all.",3
Theme Park,Nice for the kids. Not too long waits to access the rides. Desperately needs some shaded areas to sit or rest in. Food court pretty awful in terms of food and experience. The parking is a rip-off but it‚Äôs not like you have much of an alternative.,3
AZM,"The buying tickets system should be changed,
It's taking too long.",3
AZM,"It seems like a really good facility for the lower grades of elementary school to use. However, it is still under maintenance and the problems related to the Jungdo ruins are regrettable, but I hope that they will be resolved as soon as possible.",3
Theme Park,I think this place is more for like 8-year-olds and under my 9-year-old had a real good time my 12-year-old my 13-year-old and my 17-year-old enjoyed it but not as much as my 9-year-old it's more for nine and under.,3
Airport,This airport is huge. I don't recommend if you have any disability unless you have your own personal equipment,3

Theme Park,Rides are the saving grace of this park if they are open.  Not the best customer service anymore and was very disappointed with the lack of food options.  It‚Äôs all overpriced for the amount you are given too. Eat before you go!! Bring snacks if you can. I can‚Äôt stress this enough.,3
Museum,It is very cool. I just felt it was pricey for 5 minutes.,3
Museum,Would  liked to have seen exhibition on history of Chicago.,3
Water park,"Not alot of rides but not to long waiting, however.",3
Aquarium,Not as fun for two adults without any children. Only took us about 45 minutes to see everything. $70 for two tickets really wasn‚Äôt worth 45 minutes. Would‚Äôve given it possibly five stars if we had children with us.,3
Museum,For nostalgia I'd give it a 4 but the museum is definitely in need of some upgrades and facelifting on majority of it's exhibits.,3
Theme Park,"Skydrive was operating but not much else, August is difficult at Stone Mountain Park, we wanted to see the LASER Show but that also ended by end of July",3
Airport,Wish they had smoking areas instead of having to leave the airport and then go back through security,3
Airport,"Crazy busy and a bit chaotic.
But it is an international airport.",3
Aquarium,"The Aquarium was nice and I have no real complaints. I've spoken to lots of people who have visited it and had heard nothing but great things. It was a 5 hour trip each way, and while it was nice, I didn't feel it was worth the drive and expense involved.",3
Zoo,Staff was friendly but needs customer service training,3
AZM,It was neat but it didn't take long to go through. Would have gotten higher rating if the cost was cheaper. Just felt like a rip off for the price. We enjoyed Wild World a lot more.,3
Airport,"Hartsfield-Jackson is always a tough customer because it's always so busy, not my favorite airport but can't really avoid it lol.",3
Airport,Flight scheduled to leave 7;55 pm...sitiing on runway for about 40 minutes..no scheduled take off time as of yet and it is currently 10:35 pm.   The reasons for the go..no go ..are hard to understand.,3
Museum,"I expected more for what you pay. Overall not horrible but wouldn't go back. Wear closed toe shoes, several rides require them.",3
Airport,Busy airport experience as always. The tram was too full and ran too infrequently. The gate agents were kind but busy. The hard floors were easy to pull luggage and that is helpful.,3
Theme Park,"It will be awhile before we revisit as Dollywood is as expensive as Disney World.
We enjoyed having a chapel service on Sunday. And the musical shows were superb. However the food and parking were a bit overpriced.",3
AZM,"It was free because I used the Osaka Amazing Pass, but I wonder if it&#39;s too expensive to buy a ticket and enter. I wonder if it&#39;s not enough for elementary school students.",3
AZM,"Hi all‚Ä¶

Museum,Disappointed with the high cost about 25% of exhibits were not operational. Was still a fun trip but did everything in a couple hours due to so much being closed.,3
AZM,"The dolls are really real. A bit scary ü§£
One sad thing is there was no Japanese there.
The ticket was combined with aquarium and RM1300",3
Airport,Good. Except the McDonald's personal are Not welcoming at All.,3
Aquarium,"The aquarium is great, but the price is not worth it. We could go to the zoo or the Childrens museum for half the price of the aquarium. For a family of 4 it can cost over $100 for one trip. The price just seems a little outrageous for me.",3

Attraction,It's important to note this place is designed for kids. Don't go expecting a Disneyland adventure or you will be disappointed. Overall  a great place for kids but a bit outdated.,3
Theme Park,"Highly disappointed in tram service or lack of service, 3 empty trams at loading station, lots of workers, just no drivers, ended up walking to car, tough on five grandkids, after long day of lots of walkind, rides spread out, but were enjoyable.",3
Theme Park,Poor sign location to buy tickets. Splash zone was horrible. Make sure don't visit if it's overcast or about to rain. They won't let you go up the mountain.,3
Zoo,"Not very many animals for all the walking you have to do, and the main aquarium was closed until 2023? First time to this zoo and I'd have to give it to Woodland Park Zoo hands down! Best part was Hammer head sharks, stingrays and jellyfish! Oh and the tiger. Get more exhibits!!!!",3
AZM,The place is okay for kids and I think the prices are too high,3
Airport,There is a prayer room in E and F terminal.,3
AZM,"Bit of a false start on day 1 of the trip at Kentucky Kingdom yesterday. We rode the RMC then sadly everything went down for weather.

Can‚Äôt be helped, and we still had a blast in our own way. Storm Chaser is brutal as ever and my thighs are paying for it this morning.",3
Airport,Problems with baggage system resulted in ridiculously long lines.  Staff was great.  TSA was great. Just a bad day for technology that made everyone miserable.,3
Theme Park,"Very pricy, several rides closed down after waiting in line for over an hour. Would have been nice to offer a fast pass to go back after they reopened.",3
Aquarium,Time for the last stop on this leg of the Why Sharks Matter reading frenzy book tour: the Vancouver Aquarium!,3
AZM,Fun place for little children but not much animals available for viewing,3
Garden,"Very nice
Overall our stay was good however our room carpet was worn and dirty. The seafood buffet was overpriced and underwhelming $45.00 per. We are considering a return visit tho just stay away from the buffet.",3
Zoo,"There used to be more animals but in the last few years they have aged and died. ET the walrus, the polar bears, etc, all gone üò¢",3
Attraction,A fun place for kids . But way overcrowded sometimes and most of the water rides are closed without enough staffs available. Also very long queue for many rides.,3
AZM,"Very busy.. easy to get to. You need to pay for parking, you can use an app or pay at the gate when you leave.",3
Zoo,Sad to see that the polar bear has past on. Wasnt looking good last time I was there. Wish the red wolves were around. One aquarium was closed but the open one was really good.,3
Museum,"(Translated by Google) it is very small

(Original)
Es muy peque√±o",3
Airport,everything was quiet and closed but they were still doing covid tests.,3
Airport,My ears just hurt but it went ok for my first flight üòá,3
Airport,Its an airport. Secure was quick and efficient. Had a very early flight and only one place was serving coffee and that was McDonald's.  Yuck !!,3
Airport,"The new roundabout makes a huge difference getting around,  and then around again if you need to, all in all easy peasy pick up. I think the cell phone waiting are could have better signage, and the people (lazy?) In the breakdown lane waiting are dangerous imho..",3
Airport,"Got into Bradley around 630 pm. No stores were open except a Dunkin Donuts and a McDonald's. I got my luggage, the ground crew was efficient and quick getting out bags on the belt.",3
Airport,"Airport is easy to navigate, parking was increased to $10/day for the garage that is across from the terminal and as of June 2021 will be increased to $14/day. Unfortunately as of May 23, 2021 the economy parking garage was closed.",3
Airport,"Spot up tight""   % a grand later.",3
Airport,"It's an airport, mask nazis and security theater brought to you by the federal leviathan. Awful experience. Facilities are fine",3
Airport,No problem I prefer a medium size airport,3
Airport,Landed after everything was closed.,3
Airport,"Planes were all shut down due to systems being down, thank god bar was across the  gate",3
Airport,Not a bad airport. But arrival parking is ridiculous.,3
Airport,"(Translated by Google) The first outbound trip was delayed 2 hours and today's return, we had to wait on the plane to get off and to collect our bags it was also delayed.

(Original)
El primer viaje de ida se retras√≥ 2 horas y el de hoy de regreso, tuvimos que esperar en el avi√≥n para bajarnos y para recoger las maletas se retras√≥ tambi√©n.",3
Airport,"Good morning Hartford.  I have never been to an airport where there aren't restaurants open. With airlines not serving either, pick up something up on the way.",3
Airport,"(Translated by Google) Okay...

(Original)
Bueno...",3
Airport,"(Translated by Google) Okay

(Original)
Bueno",3
Airport,"Wish there was an easier option to wait for 15 minutes for someone's arrival. So many vehicles park along the road, then security moves them. And then it builds up again",3
Airport,Limited food options and extremely long lines. The airport always seems packed but it moves fast.,3
Airport,It‚Äôs a very nice airport but due to this covid outbreak nothing is open as far as food goes. But you sure can buy magazines candy sodas .,3
Airport,"Absolutely nothing to do, see, read, watch while waiting for someone on an inbound flight. Only place to even get something to drink was a small Dunkin donuts. Should add some pre security tv, music, restaurants, something for the person who is waiting for someone on a delayed flight.",3
Airport,Shuttle bus pick up between doors 4 and 5 for rental car company access,3
Airport,It was alil confusing with construction and new directions. But it easy flow very clean and neat. Make sure you get there on time or departure and arrival üõ´ there's no parking on ground. Don't come earlier. No üÖøÔ∏è..,3
Airport,"Very busy at pick up tonight
At least they let you park in shoulder of road now",3
Airport,Medium size airport.  Works ok. Nothing special.,3
Airport,Limited dining options and seating available.,3
Airport,Was packed heavy traffic but can get through fine...,3
Airport,Average size airport but needs serious modernization. Baggage claim and the airline reps for misplaced luggage were average at best,3
Airport,Everything went good except one security guard with an attitude don't know it don't know why but at the end of the day it was still a good day thanks GOD,3
Airport,Descent modern airport. With size of the airport it's nice but there isn't enough room as on busy weekends this place will have a 30 minute wait for every place to eat. Simple to find terminal and has good charging ports,3
Airport,Ok experience but many shops shut down before 8pm?,3
Airport,Its an airport...what else is there to say.,3
Airport,"(Translated by Google) Those cops without bothering.

(Original)
Esos polic√≠as sin que molestan.",3
Airport,Will never get higher than 3 stars until you get a Starbucks at the terminals.,3
Airport,Smaller airport. The pizza was not good.,3
Airport,I have never encountered a long wait here!,3
Airport,3 stars because of my rude flight attendant at American Airlines when I boarded I wish I looked at her name tag it's 530am too early for attitudes and snottiness just to scan my ticket if you don't like your job get a new one. Flight AA338 to Miami,3
Airport,"The plane went zoom but the metal detector stopped working

It wasnt able to pick up my heavy metal CDs",3
Airport,"You need a shuttle  from gate to baggage claim at least for people over 70 .
The walk is strenuous.",3
Airport,American inbound great.  Delta leaving left room to improve.,3
Airport,"If you are departing on JetBlue and have a service dog make sure that you get there early. It took over 20 minutes for management to see me and approve of service dog. Woman working for JetBlue (glasses, curly hair, maybe Hispanic) was absolutely horrible and rude. Better service with Southwest. Airport lacks good stores and restaurants. Only one pet relief station so just prepare ahead of time.",3
Airport,Do to whether they tuck the right decision,3
Airport,Not as chaotic as JFK. Do note it is not as large.,3
Airport,"Consistently slow baggage claim. Regardless of time of day or night, or which airline, some of the slowest bag pickups I‚Äôve ever experienced. This is both pre-Covid and recent. Average wait over 20 minutes once I arrive at baggage. Frustrating for a mid size  airport.",3
Airport,Small regional airport that has seen better days.,3
Airport,Well cleaned airport. Thy did not have a nursery for breastfeeding mom's in the terminal with jet blue and southwest.,3
Airport,TSA PreCheck quick. Not much open past 630,3
Airport,TSA security was a nightmare. Line to enter stretched length of terminal. Once inside all was fine as usual.,3
Airport,It was very slow to move people thru baggage check. I got there an hour and fouty five minutes early and still missed my flight. At least Cindy at the counter was nice enough to get me the quickest flight back. She is the only saving grace for my 3 stars. Otherwise it would be ONE,3
Airport,"Restroom near SW gate was a mess at 1:30 pm on May 26th, but they pulled it together by 4 pm. Food option were available.",3
Airport,Busiest I have ever seen going thru TSA. It's not even a holiday!,3
Airport,Nice airport. Traffic at pickup is bad.  Pickup at drop off works on weekend afternoons,3
Airport,"Easy to navigate, friendly airline and TSA people. However, only on sit down restaurant...sat for more than 10 minutes, while watching a waitress take care of lots of people on her side...not even a walk-by hello and a menu from the waitress on the side I sat on...then she shows up and still has no menus and was just rude. Never going back!",3
Airport,Cat on plane anoying with meowing no drinks offered on plane while waiting to leave,3
Airport,It‚Äôs cool except when you need to pick up your bags it takes them a day to get them off the plane!,3
Airport,Always a tough time parking. Always such a long wait to get to my flight. I get it is not the fault of the employees. Just wish thing could be a little simpler. Thank you to the helpfull staff that are just there to work and still try to help lost idiots like me lol. For what the employees have to put up with at WORK!!!!!! I feel they usually try to do the best they can to control the chaos.,3
Airport,I really don't like going to the airport cuz it's very hard to try to park over there and wait for somebody,3
Airport,Minor airport where you have to wait on tarmac when you arrive to be escorted in.  Maybe a Union thing where they need to finish their break?  Either way annoying and not a good look for airport,3
Airport,"Little delayed boarding which made us depart late. Dunkin Donuts prior to gates uses the app, but customer can't use to add points. Only pay if use giftcard in Dunkin Donuts app",3
Airport,"Normally I love this airport, its so easy to drive in and out. But the wait I had at security was ridiculous. 1 1/2 hour, I almost missed my flight. That might change my mind next time where I fly in and out of.",3
Airport,"No shuttle service from terminal to rental cars, I am a senior citizen with bad knees, it was a hike I didn't enjoy, I also felt that woman could be vulnerable in that corridor leading to the rental cars",3
Aquarium,"I and my family visited recently. The exhibits and dolphin spotlight was nice. I only gave a three star because of the fact that the ventilation throughout the aquarium was not good. Someway, I hope more air can be circulated especially with that many people going through and we are yet in Covid.",3
AZM,"not much statues, will complete the tour within 15-20 minutes",3
Theme Park,"Buy the water park ticket knowing that it is a separate location, 20 minutes away from the park.",3
Museum,"It was okay
Has changed a lot. Not many things for kids to enjoy anymore. And must have reservations now for tram tour",3
Museum,"Not much to explore
Not much to explore. It would be better if we have more information on Moon or Mars. It was just like a museum.  Not a spce center.",3
Aquarium,"Sharks weren't that big, employees didn't have anything very exciting to share.  Gift shop was a ripoff.",3
AZM,"Nice zoo
Lots of hills though.  Long lines for food and drinks. Wished they had better signs for figuring out where your at. Wish they had better sign or more signs.",3
AZM,"Facility itself is very clean and pretty, however, it‚Äôs so much more smaller than we expect. We spent $100( 2 adults, 1 kid under 4 which is free, and octopus picture ), and took us only 40 mins to walk the whole facility .",3
Aquarium,"I can‚Äôt believe they put people like sardines, I understand everyone wants to go, but go to contemplate the place, not the mass of people that were inside, impressive... perhaps the health system does not control the volume of people that enter?  The place is beautiful but the crowd is hellish.",3
Museum,It's a fun way to kill a couple hours with the kids. It feels like a quarter of the activities are broken at any given point however.,3
AZM,"The general atmosphere is good. There are rare and large fish. One of the most beautiful things about it is to walk, and the ground is glass in a certain section, in a section for a sea star to touch it. The price is very exaggerated. I visited an aquarium in Phuket, much better than this in stages",3
Theme Park,"So much fun!  Only got 4 stars because if you little one is under 36"" it greatly limits their ride selection. And if you are taller you won't even be able to ride with them as required on those few rides because you can't fit as a ride partner with them.",3
AZM,There is more meat and animals than you think. The main tank volume is a bit disappointing.,3
AZM,Nice but a bit small. Not much to do besides walking around the wax people:),3
Airport,The only problem was they changed the carousel my luggage was on without notification.,3
Theme Park,It's just ok. Simple short rides and basic theme park food and attractions.,3
Museum,Not to many animals out today I know it was very hot today nobody wants to be out,3
Theme Park,"Lost weight at LEGOLAND NY
Food was way overpriced for the lack of quality. Not enough water stations. Every staff member was kind and polite and acknowledged our two children. The two girls in the workshops were fabulous and your fortunate to have them. Everything was good except the food",3
Zoo,Hardly any animals. Very clean with nice exhibits but definitely not Noah‚Äôs ark.,3
AZM,"It's cute, not the greatest aquarium but nicely laid out.  However, it's grossly overpriced.  I can get the whole Omaha zoo with a much better aquarium and a whole days worth of activities for the same price as 90 minutes here.",3
Theme Park,"It is a good place to visit with the children, but there were ants wandering on the floor of the hotel and mold in the shower curtain.The swimming pool was also too small for the size of the hotel.",3
AZM,"It is a place to take infants and children, but it is not easy to move a stroller. You have to take an escalator and there is no elevator",3
Zoo,Lots of exhibits closed and animals off exhibit.  A lot of the other animals were avoiding the heat and not visible but I don't blame them.  It was warm today.  Gift shop is reasonable but drinks were expensive.,3
Airport,could use more food vendors.  Large lines at many of them.,3
AZM,Seems the zoo is spread out so much it's hard for person to walk and enjoy it.,3
AZM,"The price is too high, it is worth visiting for the first time only",3
Theme Park,"It's a nice getaway if you're local, but you can't have every single roller coaster running only a single train/car. That's today's headline. 1 car running on every single ride.  Ridiculous.",3
Aquarium,"The aquarium was nothing special, it was similar to others but still interesting. It was overcrowded and I couldn‚Äôt see all the animals but I expected that so I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The 4D Movie was good but my glasses were dirty and scrached",3
Theme Park,"Been going for 30 years, this year the new people running the rides were not as chipper and talkative as the people in the past.",3
Airport,Most places are card or mobile pay only.,3
Aquarium,"Tickets are pricey, they have a decent variety to see.",3
Airport,"Make sure you eat before you fly through. Food service is still limited, lines are backed up. The places open are working hard.",3
AZM,Love going to the zoo!! the front girl scanning cards was rude didn‚Äôt even say hi just stared and had atitude.,3
Airport,"Nice little airport, but parking is a problem. Currently, you must use the website or call day-of to see what lots are open/available/full. There‚Äôs no pre-book parking at all. This adds stress to travel.",3
Aquarium,"Very disappointed about the shows. You need to make an appointment, wait 15 minutes  for 10 or 15 show or movie. The aquariums are beautiful. Need to have better customer service.",3
AZM,Fine if you have young children. Tweens and older thought it was too babyish,3
Aquarium,"Very fun place, great for kids. My only issue is I got kicked out for trying too go fishing",3
AZM,All of the exhibits are way too small for the animals,3
AZM,"lover of trains, even on the hottest days ‚òÄÔ∏è ü•µ",3
Museum,Couldn't go up in top of building it's falling off but the rest was ok,3
Airport,It's Atlanta.  Plan accordingly,3
Airport,"Overall can't really complain... As usual way too many people, long walks between everything and the ride share drivers clog up the pick up area.",3
AZM,not too busy. But VERY HARD to find! more signs would be useful,3
Aquarium,Maybe not a place for adults. Two stars for the two hippos and one for the hammerhead. Everything else just meh‚Ä¶ not worth the money.,3
Attraction,Recommended you get a fast pass. You'll be in line for an hour for each ride.,3
Theme Park,They way they let the line saver people constantly cut ahead in the popular rides (especially lightning rod) is out of control. It makes the wait unbearable for the regular people in line. Otherwise the park was very good.,3
AZM,"going since children 7-8 last year until the latest, go again with children who are 20 years old, the price is fixed But the fish are much less, unfortunately.",3
Airport,Kinda to crowded for me but always get there a hour early trust me,3
AZM,"I took the wrong photo. This is the wax figure of Madame Tussauds Hong Kong, right? Louis Koo",3
Theme Park,Roller coasters have taken over the shows. The country living experiences are must less than I remember. Wish they would bring back more of the area heritage into the park and not copy the other plastic parks,3
AZM,Cute but not worth the hype. Would love  tonhave seen seahorse and more turtles.  More appealing to the kids. Gift is expensive  one big turtle  89.99 watch  the prices for sure.. picture  was 15.99 for one not to bad..,3
Water park,"Nice park. Pretty well run. Locker availability is a joke, though. Invest in a smart watch to get you in and out of your car or bring a designated bag carrier.",3
Theme Park,Lots of walking need to have a rides to get you around the park,3
Theme Park,Not a place to go on a very hot day! No shade and only 4 water rides. Nice for a September or October day!,3
Theme Park,"Rides are good but way too long waiting time.each ride will take more than 1 hour waiting.
.reserve and ride cost each person $100.it was not worth day for us.Have fun.",3
Museum,Good but if you already visited Natural history museum then you might not like it.,3
Museum,It's a great place for families with young children.  The information provided seems like it was geared towards a 4th grade level of understanding. My 18 year old and I were bored after an hour.,3
Airport,Very busy and non-stop of people,3
Aquarium,Went to Adventure Aquarium today where I got some cool photos of some of the exhibits! Think I might pick out one or two to paint!,3
AZM,if she finds a giraffe she will feed it ü¶í #alisonlovesgiraffes,3
Museum,"This place really isn't for me. It had some cool stuff though, such as the Indian family, & how they live, & do things.",3
Museum,I loved the different tours! pity at the level of the souvenir shops I did not find something that I liked ü•∫,3
Theme Park,I like the park but now they charge extra for the lasershow and I did not like the new version plus the lights in front and on the side are distracting during the lasershow.,3
AZM,Not many animals are in their habit. .we were pleased of the gardens just disappointed with how many animals were not available to see.,3
Airport,"‚ÄúThis train is bound for Airport Station‚Äù

Museum,"Lots of information to read but so much of the interactive stuff was broken or old

Loved seeing the rockets though!",3
Museum,Entertaining but wish the wax figures looked more like the intended people.,3
Theme Park,Always a fun time..  but I soooooo wish they would remodel their bathrooms and make more available.   More family restrooms are NEEDED. The remodel of Mystic Rivers.. meh.,3
Airport,"It required a lot of walking, this was difficult for this 68 year old retiree with knee injuries but we made our connection praise God!",3
Aquarium,"Quite disappointed, comparing with Toronto‚Äôs aquarium. Not much for adults.",3
Airport,"It required a lot of walking, this was difficult for this 68 year old retiree with knee injuries but we made our connection praise God!",3
AZM,"A place worth visiting for a souvenir The price is expensive compared to other amusement parks, but there are not many things to see and ride",3
Theme Park,"It's plenty of fun for kids up to maybe 12, but it's not a great value for the price.  For a family of four staying on-site, a two-night trip is going to cost $3000 or more.",3
Garden,"I booked my tickets on 2nd Aug for labor day weekend for the higher price, now their website is showing lower price, and they are not willing to do price match for the ticket even though I have not visited the venue. this is not a good customer response. But by co ordination they refunded money.",3
Airport,It‚Äôs busy all the time but that‚Äôs ok it‚Äôs part of it. If you drink then just get drunk and fly,3
AZM,Took the kids on a Wednesday. Larosas was not open leaving only the food trucks. They don't have good options for little ones .,3
Museum,"It was ok,  But it's some rude people that works there",3
Theme Park,Good food but not much for the young kids if they don't like roller coasters.,3
Airport,Crowded and busy as usual. Make sure to arrive two hours before takeoff!!,3
Attraction,"Drinks ok
You are allowed water and drinks only if you have a small cooler. I brought in drinks and snacks for my kid.",3
Attraction,The kids had a good time but like all theme parks everything is overpriced.,3
AZM,Very pretty but a bit small. Entry is quite expensive.,3
Aquarium,"It was very noisy, and kids running everywhere. Not alot of exhibits for the price.  I do understand that it is a place where kids will be but it would be awesome to have days for just adults.",3
Attraction,Did the hooper ticket for water park and Legoland. I wouldn't recommend taking your child if they are under 3 years old.,3
Airport,Nice terminal.  Poor choice for carpeting because it makes it difficult to pull roller bags.  Digital directory needs a color upgrade from gray on gray. Gates disappear unless you zoom in really close.,3
AZM,"I used a discount coupon. Compared to Legoland in Nagoya, the amount of fun in Unzen is different. If you can enjoy it in a small space, I think it might be possible to enjoy it with another business at Tempozan. Basically, it&#39;s better if you can play for half a day.",3
Theme Park,"The overall park is little overrated IMO, quite a few kid friendly activities Sky-ride lift to the top of the rock is good. The views are great from the top. The laser show was great and must-see. The Dino extraction and the scenic railroad are okayish.",3
Theme Park,"Went today, on a Tuesday...
Down side: Extremely long wait time for rides, rides don't hold enough people at once, and not the friendliest ride staff. Plus side: Very cool lego sculptures throughout the park, open-play jungle gyms throughout the park.

Hershey Park is better.",3
Airport,Too busy too crowded big international airport offering international flights Eateries Car rental options.,3
Aquarium,Parking is very difficult unless you visit early in the morning. It is convenient to know the location of the nearby paid parking lot in advance and come.,3
Airport,Very crowded and busy but very efficient,3
Airport,"Great airport. If you fly out of Terminal F, get food before you arrive at the terminal. All other terminals have great restaurants, while this terminal has only 3 gross food stands.",3
Aquarium,Didnt let me buy there otter known as ‚Äúkat mai‚Äù.,3
Museum,"there's ere are lots of activities that adults can engage in. Very busy place but entertaining and lots of hands on activities.  Pricey! Purchase your tickets ahead of time and online, it's cheaper.  Look for coupons to use.",3
Museum,very very expensive and it was okay but it needs more people,3
Attraction,"The park itself is ok, when there are minimal lines it's good. Don't pay for early entrance. We got in an hour early and only 4 rides were open, my kids could only go on 3. Maybe Legoland had the case of the Mondays and just sucks for early entrance. The BBQ and apple fries are good.",3
Museum,Very interesting place. Worth the money if they fixed all broken attractions.,3
Aquarium,It's a fun way to spend a couple of hours every once and awhile. My kids like it. The food is expensive for what you get.,3
Airport,Except the security line it wasn't so bad for an airport.,3
Garden,"Certainly worth the price of admission. Can get very crowded. Also make sure to bring your own refreshments or snacks, there isn't much to buy here.",3
Museum,Incredibly busy and probably to be expected.. other then the tours and the usual exhibits there's nothing really new here. If you're a fan of NASA..I would recommend Kennedy space center.,3
Museum,Not sure it was worth the money. We were done in about 30 minutes and spent over $100 for the family. Some of the figures were not realistic either.,3
Museum,Little run down but still good.  There were only two staff members that seemed to want to be there the rest could care less... great job Samantha there was another team member how ever I did not catch her name but she was working Lazer  tag..,3
Museum,"Several attractions were not functioning. Seems they are short staffed like other places, as was a slow weekday after kids back in school but still struggling to keep up with attendance",3
AZM,"yes, it was a good visit. But very disappointed not to see any Messi's statue there. üòë",3
AZM,K..not that great .... Bollywood stars sculptures was not that gr8 expect few1,3
Theme Park,Id say its Great for kids 6 and under. The lines are way too long and many rides were partially not working making the wait even longer,3
Theme Park,"Beautiful park but very overpriced, especially when adding trailblazer. Only to have multiple roller coasters be closed.",3
Airport,"It's an airport, wish there was a better sit down restaurant there",3
Aquarium,"Chicago day 2:
Shed aquarium, millennium park, an amazing dinner, some shopping, and now relaxing by the pool (moms got a drink in hand). Walked close to 6 miles today. Tired, but SO many memories made! ü•∞ü§ç

#vacation #chicago #myguys #endofsummer #morefuntomorrow",3
Airport,Needs more seating. Benches inside maybe. Very hard to find seating when waiting for a long time.,3
Theme Park,Few attractions and almost everything closed and should be accessible with older people not charging them the same as a teenager who climbs almost everything,3
AZM,The place is stunning but we finished the whole story in half an hour.. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth the money. The underwater observatory in Eilat is definitely more worthwhile.,3
AZM,"Nothing more than nice, you can cancel the price is expensive for the value.. The price for an adult is 1390 baht and for a child 1190 baht.",3
AZM,"Lots of areas under construction, lots more with no animal on display.
Cheetah runs were the best - would have been a lot better without the corny staff ZBI story dialog",3
AZM,"It's pretty neat. It's very short for $35 per person. You can stay as long as you like, but there's only so long you can watch the same fish swim in circles. They do have a live stingray touch tank which is neat. We probably spent 30-45 minutes there.",3
Aquarium,I had a great experience. But I was charged twice for a parking ticket because their machine couldn't scan the ticket I bought online. I will be calling them for a refund on a parking ticket I bought online,3
Museum,The field museum is good overall however the washrooms were not maintained at all and we're stinky!!,3
AZM,"Some of the animal exhibits were very good and spacious, however, the zoo is very confusing and the map is not up to par.  It is hard to follows the trails too look for certain animals.",3
AZM,(Translated by Google) just like that (Original) Í∑∏ÎÉ•Ï†ÄÎÉ•,3
Airport,"Clean, well maintained. However, a very spread out design and an awful walk to A, B, or C when the tram and walkway are broken down.",3
Museum,Sad cage sizes for several of the animals and I was a bit surprised by the ticket price. Worth it if you're after a distraction for the kids.,3
Theme Park,ON SET AS AN EXTRA FOR DOLLY'S NEW MOVIE MOUNTAIN MAGIC CHRISTMAS...LOOK FOR ME IN THE AUDIENCE THIS WINTER!ü§óüòâ,3
Attraction,"Lots of fun but kinda pricey
Lego land was awesome! The food at the Ramen place was yucky so I would try something else. Also, the fast pass is a must but it's super expensive.",3
Airport,Not enough seats at the gates. I was disappointed üòû,3
AZM,"It&#39;s a wicked place that charges a parking fee, but it&#39;s a good place to take children under the age of 10. I haven&#39;t been riding much since I was 11.",3
Airport,"Still under construction, so give yourself a little extra time to get bags at baggage claim and get to off-site parking.",3
Theme Park,My wife could not ride and it would be a big deal if she was a big girl she only 250 and I just thank that it's nothing but a wast of money,3
Airport,"More like 3.5 stars.Similar to TF Green in Providence but bigger and not as good. Fairly clean and efficient as far as airports go. Amenities are adequate but the process of getting from the rental car area with baggage is cumbersome. Waiting areas are clean. Outside is clearly marked for directions. It is a decent option in the Massachusetts,RI and CT corridor",3
Attraction,Bring good walking shoes or your feet will remind you of why.,3
Zoo,"We went to ptdefiancezoo this weekend. Tempy decided this fish needed a name, so meet Mimi.",3
Aquarium,"Too crowded and very high priced when it comes to food and beverages. Whatever happened to water fountains?
Other than that, amazing experience!!",3
Zoo,The garage kicked me and the elephant said no one will believe you and then it stoped talking and went swimming,3
Museum,Fun experience but a bit pricey for how small it is.,3
Theme Park,Golf course was fun but not challenging by any means. Clubs were sticky. Had to buy tickets at the wax museum but wouldn‚Äôt let us take a picture in the lobby.,3
Airport,"Everything was okay, other than that it was a bit busy üòä",3

Airport,It's Bradley Air. Not a giant airport but a pain to get through. tsa is really strict. And rather detailed in searches. Heads up if you have medical devices arrive a few hours early. They will scan and search everything,3

Airport,"Not too bad of an airport compare to others. Some gates are not fun to be at, feels like people are cramped in one spot. Other airports are spacious but this one‚Ä¶ is rather interesting! Check one of the pics‚Ä¶

Museum,The reptile section need to be updated and cleaned.  Things are aging and not being kept up with (dull non correct colors and some information seemed to need updating).  Years ago I enjoyed it a lot more than this visit. Hopefully by next visit it has improved.,3
Aquarium,"If you've been to other aquariums you will find this place disappointing. It's expensive, crowded and filthy. There are some cool exhibits but even with the staggered entry and timed tickets this feels abysmally packed and hard to see some exhibits for longer than a few seconds",3
Attraction,It was good.  Not too many rides like I was expecting but overall was ok,3

AZM,It's nice but the animal enclosures are very small. Makes me sad to see such large animals in such small enclosures just to look at. Also not offering straws for drinks and even slushies is a bit ridiculous. I get we're trying to save the turtles but it's a slushie for Christ's sake.,3
Zoo,It's nice but think your better off doing woodland park and Seattle Aquarium more to see that way!,3

Museum,Very interesting  but needs some updating and exhibit repairs,3

Museum,It was hmmm ok. Most looked like who they were supposed to look like. Some you had to really had to look hard to see the resemblance. The Zombie  room was great.,3
AZM,For scuba diving inside shark tank we need to do advance booking atleast one or two days before. For discount book tickets on klook website.,3
Aquarium,"The aquarium is nice but it is a bit expensive for what it is, plus more charges for parking and some other extra stuff inside.

Aquarium,"It was ok‚Ä¶. Customer service was subpar at best. Makes you appreciate the stellar service at a place like, Springfields Aquarium.",3
Airport,"About average, not bad but not great either.",3
Airport,The airport it self isn't that bad the problem is it's to small for the amount of people that are inside of it. In some spots you have to go single file because the side restaurants are packed and have people waiting but they're all in the middle of the concourse so when you're trying to get to a connecting flight you have to move people out of the way.,3
Museum,"It is big but not huge. Quite good for kids but a bit boring for adults, it has not many things about current mission. If you want to take the tram reserve before 1pm otherwise will be totally booked. Parking is 5 dollars. And the gift shop is expensive and has simple gifts.",3

Airport,It's the busiest airport in the world. Enough said.  It's a long day.,3

Airport,It's an airport. Could use more restaurants,3
Theme Park,Nice place. Not enough to do for the price. Parking needs to be rethought,3
Aquarium,"Awesome exhibits, very clean.
Disappointed we went straight from Sea Lion show to Dolphin show and they closed the doors in our face. The show was empty too. They said we could come back in 4 hours! No way to stay that long. They need to work on their schedule!",3
AZM,The first and most likely will be the only lego land in Korea. Attractions are for children and children only. Adults without kids will easily be bored,3

AZM,"Overpriced
Part of the Ripley‚Äôs tourist traps. Overall very expensive for maybe 1 hour of entertainment for 2 adults. 40 minute drive next door to Springfield for the Nation‚Äôs best aquarium (which was cheaper and phenomenal). Overall would be good for small children.",3
Attraction,Overpriced stay and disgusting food. The only thing that salvaged it somewhat was that the kids had fun.,3

Theme Park,I have always love going but for real they should post that everything is shut down except the sky ride because I would have waited to go. . because 20.00 for parking just to see one thing was just outrageous to me and 44.00 just for that one sky ride.,3

Airport,"Cool art displayed in some parts of the hallways that was created by kids in all ages. Incredible work! With regards to things to to, sanitary and food there is room for improvements. Specally toilets were terrible (dirty)",3
Theme Park,(Translated by Google) It&#39;s tiring to climb to the top of the mountain (Original),3
Aquarium,Need electric handicap chairs for the disabled. Not everyone has someone to push them around. Also need to have windows reserved for the handicap so people can see. Other people are just inconsiderate& rude and won't move and they will get in front of you.,3
Theme Park,So far it's just ok. Like other parks just run down over the years,3
Airport,"Improved a lot in the last few years when it comes to infrastructure. However, TSA here usually are major a*******.",3
Museum,"Most of the interactive stations were out of order and the place was packed. None of the rides were open and the price of food was outrageous. The kids loved it and it was very educational, but with the money they charge you would think everything would be working and open.",3
Aquarium,"The experience was great however, DO NOT PURCHASE THE SKIP THE LINE PASS ! It is a SCAM ! We paid $12 per ticket to skip the line and was told by 2 ever , ‚ÄúThere is no skipping ahead.‚Äú",3
Theme Park,They should keep the sky ride open after 7pm.  The train was fun but the three little pigs gig was too loud . Laser show too short and left people confused about the ending.,3
Garden,"It's good but it is a lot.  I would say don't try to see everything in one day.

Also,  maybe avoid Saturday if you can.  There were a lot of areas closed off for wedding parties.
Food and drinks are expensive.",3
Museum,"The nasa part of it all, is great, but they need to fix some of the stuff that is broken. Considering this is nasa, I didn't think they would have broken Exhibits, sadly they did",3
Zoo,"This zoo is all right, for being the biggest animal zoo in Utah.  I wish the animal exhibit's looked a little cleaner, and the animal's looked happier.  But not much you can do when the animal's are living in small enclosed spaces.",3
Theme Park,Eat before you enter the Park. Food are expensive and not that good.,3
Airport,"So big and busy! Whenever booking your flight and your connecting flight is in Atlanta, make sure you have at least 45 minutes to an hour or longer to get through the airport. Unless of course you're a track star!",3
Airport,"I find Sacramento airport very easy to navigate once inside.  The outside driving around part, not so much, I find it confusing but I am directionally challenged.  However, even Uber drivers have had some difficulty finding the pickup spot which is not very traveller friendly.",3
AZM,"We went after labor day weekend when the waterpark side was closed but the ticket prices were the same.  Many of the employees I don't want to say were rude but seemed to be tired and ""over the season"".  We will visit earlier next year.",3
Museum,"The place was nice and engaging. However, would give it only 3 stars because of the price.",3
Museum,"Little to do.
Over priced ticket items but okay for kids. Need more organization of the offered tours.  The host made it clear the app is not user friendly. My suggestion would be, the corporate team need to address it so avoid long lines at the ticket counter.",3

Airport,"The airport seemed fine, restrooms were not the cleanest, but there was enough seating space. The big issue we had both arriving and departing is waiting for the shuttle to and from the rental cars. We waited about 30 minutes both ways. Need better visual cues for line forming instructions as well because as new people come up they inadvertently cut in pine.",3
AZM,Ok place. Juz photo session. Less celebrity in Bangkok branch.,3
Airport,"It's a pretty good airport.  There are certainly much worse(Chicago), but the do some stupid things like the cones ensuring a mess at arrivals",3
AZM,(Translated by Google) Go also bt. Many areas are not very special. (Translated by Google) Go well bt. Many areas are not very special.,3
Airport,"Busy! United is on North side no curbside service come on! Did Delta last time, curbside service was great and better food/snack/store on south side of terminal. I get it its Delta's hub....you can tell!",3
Aquarium,It's a cool experience but it's too expensive for how quickly you look at everything . The one time was enough for us to never go back .,3
AZM,"The aquarium itself was fine. It definitely is geared towards children and families. And they have good exhibits. But for two adults to go through, paying over 80 dollars (with tax) for two tickets, the experience was not worth that much.",3
Zoo,"(Translated by Google) Very nice and everything but the animals look super sad

(Original)
Mui bonito y todo pero los animales se miran super tristes",3
Theme Park,"Long waits need to improve!
The park is clean and beautiful but we did not go on half the rides because none of us would have survived the wait times. Even for food the wait was insane. The park needs to make serious adjustments if they want return visitors.",3
Attraction,"We visited this since the entry was included in our go city pass. It will be an absolute fun place for kids but for a group of only adults, the rides were underwhelming. The miniature city creations with legos were are a must to check out.",3
Aquarium,Nice experience. Diego is my favorite sea lion. STAY AWAY from the cafeteria the cheeseburgers your insides will thank you,3
Airport,"(Translated by Google) A small field, adequate services, there is not too much to do/buy, what there is, the prices are very expensive, worth coming near the flight (Original) to do/buy, whatever the prices are terribly expensive, it&#39;s worth coming near the flight",3
Theme Park,"Great for a sunrise hike. Other than that, too busy for me. I like more wilderness",3
Airport,"Busy as usual, but not too busy",3
Attraction,"We went on a Friday and Saturday, we did the park on Friday & water park on Saturday...",3
Airport,Workers seemed very unorganized and panicked... was told to go to a certain line get there and was told to go to a different line twice. Finally get to tsa and the gentleman pushing bins thru the scanner just kept shoving bins thru dumping several over.  Get it together,3
Aquarium,Aquarium was great! The lady that sold the tickets was extremely rude!!,3
Theme Park,Everything was great.  The food prices are ridiculous. Huge walk from handicap parking to gate. Tram didn‚Äôt seem to be running.,3
Zoo,Lived in Denver 20 yrs in Park Hill - really miss it. At lunch I'd take my lunch to sit in front of the lions.,3
Theme Park,Way too expensive and and it seems like the park only caters to the rich Rather than all families,3
Museum,"Some figures did not look right, but others looked so lifelike",3
Museum,Was not ad big as I had expected and we did the extra 3  attractions and the man in the castle was extremely rude. I won't go back and waste money there again.,3

Zoo,they allow the birds to just go where they please! luckily the birds do not come near me or my family,3
Airport,"This airport has two terminals, easy to get to at non rush hour. Sometimes it can be very foggy in the morning especially after a rainy day!
Food some what pricey. parking was not so easy at the holidays, cars broken into too.

Overall ok experience going through this airport comparing to other airports!",3
Museum,You can really get lost in there. I didn't know what to expect going in there but I sure couldn't expect what lied ahead lol,3
Airport,Just a single restaurant in the International terminal before security.,3
Theme Park,Good times but food is not quality for the price you pay. Second time our food has been cold.,3
Museum,"(Translated by Google) It&#39;s funny, but a little disappointed by the stars not necessarily very successful... (Original)",3
Airport,Long TSA line but very nice agents.,3
Museum,"It's a super cool place with an abundance of things to do and experience, but be prepared for employees with the excitement of a pet rock. Honestly a bunch of the things I wanted to do I skipped on because I didn't want to deal with their attitude and feeling like a bother to them for being here",3
AZM,Only complaint is some things where closed other then that we had a great time,3
Museum,Fun place to visit when everything is working. It costs too much money to not have a chance to experience everything.,3

AZM,"(Translated by Google) This is a good place for lovers or children, and the Lego-made works were great. Food price I think souvenirs are very expensive (Original) This is a great place for lovers or children to come.",3
Airport,"For the west economy parking lot, be prepared to wait longer when returning from a trip. You may see 2 or 3 East economy parking lot buses go by before you see the next West economy parking lot bus. We have had to wait 15 to 20 minutes for the west economy parking lot shuttle to pick us up when returning from a trip.",3
Theme Park,I love the place and this time the lines for the attractions weren't near as long as previous visits. The only complaint I would have is the ticket prices and prices to purchase things in general.,3
Aquarium,The place was too crowded to enjoy. I wish they had guides or something to make the viewing of the animals/fish easier. I felt like I was competing for view of the animals smh.,3
Attraction,My kids are teenagers now so we didn't like this attraction as much however I am sure families with kids ranging from 3-11 would definitely love it.,3
Airport,Baggage claim needs to be revamped.,3
Aquarium,(Translated by Google) Friendly but not worth the price (Original),3
Museum,"Average
the blue tour and the white tour should be combined in to one tour. it will save lots of time for both parties.  besides, the conductor (the talking) of the tours are 50% same.",3
Airport,The new terminal is a much needed improvement. Very glad to see CLEAR has been added to Sacramento airport as well.,3
Theme Park,Fun place for the family... But way overpriced.... The entry tickets were around $90 And food was extremely overpriced.,3
Airport,The bathrooms and the food ¬†choices aren't the best hence the rating. The posted wait time listed for screening was also off by about thirty minutes.,3
Museum,"Fun Pix
We enjoyed our visit, some of the figures look really cool, others we needed to read the label.  You can take selfies with those you like, took about 20 minutes to go through.  I would suggest they lower prices or offer discounts,",3

Theme Park,I enjoyed visiting but I was disappointed in the number of shows closed for the day.  I went on a Sunday.,3
Museum,I didn't do much research on this place so I went in not knowing what to except and honestly I wasn't really impressed. This place is more for children. It was kinda neat and I would recommend it to people with kids.,3
Theme Park,Be prepared to walk hills and bring sunglasses. The sun is absolutely blinding,3
Airport,The only airport where Clear + Precheck takes just as long as not having it.,3
Airport,Extremely busy airport I wish that they had more gate departure screen,3
Airport,"Not much open, clear was BS, took longer than pre check.",3
Theme Park,Displays were great.  Most rides for young kids only. Food very expensive. Pack your own meals. Several rides and/or Displays not operating. Lots of walking and inclines so wear comfortable shoes. We went on a cooler day so I'd recommend doing that. Granddaughters did enjoy themselves very much.,3
Attraction,This place is really catered for kids. It's basically the Lego brand being advertised with an amusement park included. I would have given it more stars if all the rides and attractions are all open to everyone. The food served are quite expensive and not too many options.,3
AZM,(Translated by Google) I can go from Yujiwon to 2nd grade in elementary school. Anything more than that is childish (Original),3
AZM,"it's just so so. The walking way is narrow, some places are smelly.",3
AZM,I wish they have Tom Cruise at a better place instead of the souvenir shop. Lol,3
AZM,"Just like the one located along Hollywood Boulevard, only difference here is they have more recognizable Asian figures. I recommend buying tickets in advance to skip the queue.",3
Airport,Easy to navigate. Can be very crowded and chaotic.,3

AZM,Even though they don‚Äôt know it they have been dead since 1897 and are still exploring at Zoo Tampa. If you would like to meet the deceased head on over to Zoo Tampa for a family friendly spooky adventure on select dates in October!,3
Museum,"Unless your a real space fanatic, which i am, though the displays are awesome, did not enjoy very much. Don't know why ...",3
Attraction,"Ugh
Hours to the park were not long enough to complete park and a lot of food places were closed. Rides were okay but not all could be completed",3
Museum,"This is a great place to visit. Good tour of the facility. However, there are a lot of buildings they don't take you to. What they don't show you is the really good stuff.",3
Theme Park,"Some parts of the park were temporarily closed, but it was the regular admission..",3
Airport,It‚Äôs not that easy to find the Uber pickups,3
Museum,It was ok... worth a visit. But not at all what I anticipated,3
Theme Park,"Lighting was poor-across the park,unlit rides&parking lot! Easy to trip&fall. Park is quite hilly& not accessible 2 wheelchairs in certain areas.Would like to have seen more Dolly Parton souveniers.Only saw 1 or 2 park workers the whole time.No one to answer questions we had.",3

Airport,Just follow the signs and you will be okay! Red is the Delta side and the Blue side is for the other airlines. Always pay attention to you door number e.g S6.  There is an Uber and Lyft pickup  area. International departure and return has its own area. You can ask the airport police or airport workers for direction if you get stuck or feel lost.,3

Airport,"It's a big airport, I feel bad for the people who have to clean up after the sloppy passengers",3
Museum,"A bit too pricey. Not as much stuff as I thought would be inside. Gets boring pretty quickly once glancing at everything inside. So many stairs to go up. Boring alone, must bring someone with to be a bit more fun.",3
Museum,"The figures are good, however it takes a total of 20 minutes to go through it all. I was expecting a bit more.",3
Garden,I went last year and I just hope this year isn't as sorry and overpriced. Lights were nice maze was ok but admission is steep just to get in and pay for everything.,3
Museum,"The content was amazing, but I've never seen a more disorganized cluster in your tram lines, maybe spend some time training visitor staff like you do the astronauts.",3
Theme Park,"Fun but still a few things to work out
They need more staff for efficiency. They left a lot of seats/cars empty even with long lines. Several rides closed. Had trouble with the photo program. Still fun and nice to see all the models. Very clean!",3
Airport,Make sure that you pay attention to color coding on the signs!,3
Theme Park,"Parking is terrible.  Trying to squeeze as many as they can but spaces are small
More than once we have been made to park at splash country when several closer spaces are clearly available. Also the wait test on app for rides does not seem accurate.",3
Theme Park,"Clean, super nice but SO inefficient. Please hire more ppl to increase the flow. When you have only one person to check height, open the gate, check the belts, run the ride, open the cars, the gate, check that nobody got forgotten in the ride:80% of the time the ride isn‚Äôt actually running.",3
Zoo,"Insufficient animals.  A nice walk through beautiful grounds, but more animals at the zoo would have been nice.",3
Theme Park,It was lovely other than signage as to how to get about the park was very poor! We had a very hard time finding our way OUT of the park. I also didn't like that they herd you through the store to exit the park. ¬†Otherwise a nice wholesome place for families.,3

Theme Park,"We love this place for kids , but in our room the water in the bathtub took a long time to go away. Also the cleaning lady came to wake us up two hours before the check out with the sign ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù at the door. Food was ‚Äúok‚Äù people in the kitches was so nice.",3
Theme Park,Should open pool earlier would like to use it before going to the park. Need microwave in rooms,3
Theme Park,My friends room hade about 100 ants in to there room other then that I loved it and you should visit to.,3
Theme Park,"Of all the legoland resorts, these rooms are my least favorite, very small. I do like the playgrounds out front of each little beach hut though. Had to call for service a few times before they came.",3
Theme Park,Decent place for smaller kids. Wait time for rides weren't bad at all. Park is too small with not enough rides for what you pay for tickets though.,3
Theme Park,"If you have kids highly  recommend  checking it out and the water park. Pack some  food cause  leggo land doesn't  has much for food and loooooooomg waite time
A lady waite 45 to 1.5 just for a small hotdog n drink",3
Theme Park,My foster daughter got to go for her make a wish .I was a little disappointed a lot of the food vendors were closed ..üò™,3
Theme Park,1 hour waits for every ride. Boat ride broke down with my mother in law and 5 year old on it stuck for over 30 minutes before someone came and got them leaving my 9 year old niece stuck by her self at the exit.,3
Theme Park,It was good! It's not a place I would go back to. I enjoyed the few adult rides they have but I think this is over played and not as exciting as in real life,3
Theme Park,"Kids love it. Parents hate the very, very long wait to get high priced food. Each place had limited choices and it still took 45 minutes to get food.",3
Theme Park,Too expensive lockers and very slowly fast food. But atractions are the best.,3
Theme Park,"Overpriced, no surprise there.
You pay extra for everything. Even a locker was$18. Good for little kids",3
Theme Park,Wait on line for food was crazy!! A hour. One cashier. Need to update POS system. Thought there would be more Lego displays.,3
Theme Park,It was a fun day but it needs some attention. There's a lot of damaged pieces and even the main entrance had peeling paint. Some of the staff seemed like they could care less about the guest.,3
Theme Park,This is not Disney Customer service is lousy Customer service is lousy But the Park is good for little kids,3
Theme Park,Do adults have to pay full price with tickets if they not riding on anything,3
Theme Park,"They have a great thing where you buy a cup and have free refills all day including icees however you can only get icees in 1 area of the park. So if you don't know this and you don't get the that area, no icees for you.",3
Theme Park,Great fun for the kids but it is very expensive for a group.,3
Theme Park,Able to do all the rides and go to the water park all in one day. More of a destination for families with young children. Food and facilities are subpar compared to other amusement parks.,3
Theme Park,"While there were some rides for young children, this park is geared to slightly older children (5+).",3
Theme Park,"Not so much to do or see.
Food wasn't great, the lines to get on the rides weren't long but rides were not great.",3

Theme Park,The day would've been fun but we got rained out.  Maybe n two years.,3
Theme Park,Limited amount of rides but decent things like unlimited drinks if you buy an expensive cup. I will dub it Dollywood of Florida.,3
Theme Park,"Closed down a while for weather. Wouldn't buy unlimited photos unless you go to the character area. Nice experience overall, just didn't get to use cabana and waterpark as much as I would of liked to. Would recommend flying experience in the Duplo area!",3
Theme Park,The park is fun but the lines for entry and food are atrocious. It shouldn't take an hour to serve ten people in a quick service line.,3
Theme Park,"Everything was awesome...til a baby took his diaper off and they had to shut down everything but the lazy river, lol. Seems like a poor design to have all the water circulating between slides, pools, etc.",3
Theme Park,"Way overcrowded. Very steep hills. Shows and food vendors had lines that went forever. We never got to see any shows, and spent our entire all-day visit waiting in lines. The general store was nice. Paid $85 for one adult ticket, and was extremely disappointed. üò•",3
Aquarium,Extensive display and lots to see. Did not like the price for a 2 hour experience. $30 a person (even w/ Kroger discount tickets) is too high in my opinion.,3
Airport,"Very large, only somewhat functional signage, incompetent baggage handlers.",3
Theme Park,A lot of rides shut and long lines and the ride app is open to everyone to use giving you an hr wait to get on  and takin a child with a disability unlike previous years could go to the handicapp line and get on now there are not really accommodations just wait lists,3
Theme Park,"Disturbed the front ticket person didn't  mention that venues close at 5:00. Closing need to be  published
We come around 4:15. Why fees not published in flyer? I'm aware of seasonal changes but that would be good to publish in flyer.",3
Museum,They was 2 of the attraction that wasn't working it took 1 hr and half for my child to get on rope course,3
Museum,"It was intersting with wax figures not found in other wax museums, but I expected more.",3

Museum,"The tram tour is not so great: could barely hear the guide, very little explanations.",3
Museum,"REMEMBER to get entrance BEFORE 4PM, even it says it closes 5PM.",3
Zoo,"Well, it was a nice day to go to the zoo with my family except...it appears they are doing construction in areas of the park and also....I guess because it was hot alot of the animals were just laying down and some exhibits there were no animals at all.",3
Airport,Lots of space and reasonable food choices. Could do with more convenience food stores and duty free. A Walgreens or CVS or Target would be amazing and there is plenty of space!! CNN and Hudson are basically the same shop so it's pointless.,3
Theme Park,Nice scenery but parking exit strategy and entry tram system sucks. Park is chopped up and somewhat aggravating to navigate. Wheel chair would be very difficult to use on the uneven hills.,3
Theme Park,"Cool place, the roller coasters ok. It‚Äôs fall time so all the pumpkins are out , it looks awesome.  The park and food are overpriced just like every other amusement park.",3
Museum,(Translated by Google) I&#39;ve seen better ones. (Original) I&#39;ve seen better ones.,3
Zoo,"This place has beautiful landscapes and gardens but not very many animal's, Some exhibits were empty, there are no animals from the PNW. When you go to a zoo you want to see animals because a day at the zoo isn't cheap.",3
Theme Park,"For now, I give it a 3 star. They are still building this place up. More to come but at this time just know it's not up to par yet. You can still visit and enjoy a fun day there it's just still new with trees planted that will take some time for it to have shade.",3
Theme Park,Park was fun. Concessions ruined it. Only one place to get food or drinks. ¬†I wanted 2 soft drinks only. I have been in line 34 minutes and counting. Still a long way to go.,3
Attraction,"Dusty rooms
The hotel was overall very cute for kids but the room was extremely dusty. The curtains, Lego figurines and kids bunk. There was also a spider in the kids area.",3
Airport,Be ready to travel due to size of airport,3
Theme Park,"Great pumpkin show, lots of great artesian. But if you're looking for something cheap this is nowhere to go. If it's hard for you to climb hills, you might want to rethink going.",3
Airport,This town parties harder than I do - even at the airport at 6am.,3

Unknown,"(Translated by Google) The hotel is cute and well made, but the operation is disappointing Hotel food is the worst... (Original)",3
Airport,TSA lines are LONG so add extra time!!,3
Theme Park,"The park is really fun, though they need to lighten up on the overzealous safety measures or staff their rides to account for the ones in place. Current setup is inefficient and creates unnecessarily long wait times.",3
AZM,"Kids loved it. Some of the volunteers were really informative and interacted great with our kids. The food and gifts shops are over priced, so bring snacks and pass on the t-shirt.",3
Theme Park,"Busy day, but parking instruction not good enough, so many blocked without giving proper instruction for next parking spot",3
Airport,Came here to catch a ride with Groome.,3
Museum,"It's alright. Very touristy. Too crowded, full of kids. Cafeteria is affordable ans good food!",3
Zoo,The only thing I would change and improve is the hippo enclosure.,3
Aquarium,"VERY Crowded
This is an amazing aquarium, but be careful when you go. We went on a Saturday and the place was uncomfortably crowded.",3
Garden,Guess what Callaway Gardens all of our 12 oz mason jars are marked down to $15 for the rest of the evening!!!,3
Theme Park,"Outdoor spaces are wonderful, attractions and events are not worth the ticket price.",3
Attraction,"Expected more for what I paid for...
When they said ""DELUXE"" I expected this grand room.The kids room,if you even call it a room...my 4'11"" son can touch the bed and the wall with his arms stretched out.For what I paid for,sad to say...I'm not happy,but the staff were great.",3
Attraction,"Honestly, just save up for Disney. Legoland needs a good power washing and paint lift. To say the employees are unenthusiastic would be a polite understatement. Luckily my kids were oblivious and still had a good time. I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôll go out of my way to return.",3
Airport,"Get there early if you have to catch a flight. There are hit and miss days ( some days easy to get through TSA and no lines). Please take off your shoes, belt, have ID ready and push your luggage in the TSA line. Don't be slow and hold up the line. You need to be fast and think fast because there are many people rushing to get through the line.",3

Airport,Headed to bury my grandmother in Alaska. She will be missed. We love you grandma. #jreknewgives,3
Zoo,It's ok . Not very good parking also not paved all around make sure you take your hiking shoes for the parking lot and the zoo. Alot of the native landscape is over grown makes it hard to see some of the animals. Bit it was a ok experience needs more of an upgrade.,3
Airport,"Clean, small airport ..reason for rating is the very long taxi stand wait. But it was Diwali .. So I was told this could affect service.",3
AZM,"Well designed aquarium- but basically 1 big tank at different angles..
pretty expensive for what it is. Not a terrible place- but pricey.
We did go on a slow Monday afternoon, so that was nice. Basically had the place to ourselves",3
Theme Park,They did not have enough people working the rides or the attractions. They had moved a lot of the seats and benches so people could sit down. It appears to be going down a bit.,3
Museum,There is a map but you are given no explanation on how to read it. We missed out on over half of the tour and didn't know until to late that there were other sections to see.,3
Airport,"It‚Äôs a nice old airport but so far spread out. Takes very long to get through TSA and that‚Äôs even with Pre-check. Have to take sky train, subway train, and a monorail to get anywhere. Rental car lot is nice and huge. They should nickname this place little Texas of Atlanta.",3
AZM,(Translated by Google) Parking is not clear and very little attention. (Original),3
Museum,Buy the all access pass and visit guiness book of world records museum for $5 more,3
Airport,They need to get lockers for people to store carry on bags during extended layovers.,3

Pro Tip: Activate your pass during the week to avoid longer lines. Also don't forget to bring proof of age!",3
Theme Park,Very disappointed that Dolly Museum was closed...felt could have had a small museum set with Dolly coat of Many Colors in it. The music groups were very good.,3
Airport,"Lots of cars are ""crowding"" up the South Terminal because the cell phone lot has moved by Taxi & Limo waiting lot and In stead of following new signage they're sitting in long lines where the old cell lot was.",3

Airport,PLAN ACCORDINGLY-- LONG SECURITY LINESMonday morning 6:30am: Domestic South Terminal the TSA PRE CHECK line took me an hour and 20 minutes and I watched the ¬†line only got longer -- grew out the doors and wrapped around the luggage carousels. Arrive early!,3

AZM,"Food in the zoo was great, but didn't like how the layout of the zoo was we would miss things and have to backtrack over and over again. We went I guess when bird flu was going on and alot birds where put up, and then just alot animal exhibits where closed. I suggest buying tickets in advance.",3
Airport,"Nice airport, but security was a nightmare. Agents were yelling things that nobody could understand, and nobody knew to whom they were yelling.  TSA PreChek, here I come!",3
Theme Park,Cant say too much the park activities was closed by the time we got there. Staff could have told us they where closed before paying $20 to park for nothing.,3
Airport,Clean...friendly not enough seats while waiting for boarding... At southwest Some A section handicap passengers had to stand a long time,3
AZM,"A lot of closed exhibits, due to construction and or avian flu. Otherwise it was great.",3
Theme Park,Would have been 5 stars if everything was open..and I didn't like the fact that the bald eagles were in such a confined space,3
Theme Park,"Very similar to Dollywood,  basically set up as a pioneer town. Lots of rides to go on (we are old and don't partake in rides). We found lots to do and had a decent time. Biggest complaint is the hills. We are not in great physical shape and found tge hills quite challenging.",3
Museum,"The Museum itself is not that big, so consider to schedule one of the free tours available.",3
Airport,SPIRIT AIRLINES. PUT A SIGN UP TO USE MACHINES TO CHECK IN BEFORE GETTING IN LINE. POOR!,3
Airport,Super confusing airport.  Give yourself time if you have not been here before,3
Zoo,Several animals are no longer there.  Habitats need maintenance.,3
Theme Park,"Rained that whole time we were there... Had to cut it short, but weather is not under silver dollar city's control. All in all, would have been a great time otherwise...",3

Museum,I was so scared that the building was upside downThen we went in the spinning Cave and we went to a storm center in the outer space Center and the arcade,3
AZM,It was nice to go to the zoo it's been awhile but a lot of things weren't out or open.,3
Museum,Fuck yeah! This place is tits! Dinosaurs and other old stuff. People here aren't snooty and I can be myself. Only thing is parking can be hard. Kind of hard to get too. GO BUCKEYES!!!,3
Museum,"This was enjoyable but I left wishing there was more to see. We took some fun pictures and had a good time, it's just a small wax museum overall. If it hadn't come with our tickets package we probably wouldn't have gone.",3
Attraction,Way too expensive for small amusement park. Good for kids under 13. ¬†Food was better than Disneyland. ¬†Lego there were costly but had some special ones you can't get in regular stores.,3
Airport,Need more signage to gates when exiting the train,3
Theme Park,They run out of food items and don't notify you through the posted menu so you wait in line for 30 minutes and can't get what you want. Fun park otherwise.,3
Airport,"Watch your transfers, it's a big airport...",3
Museum,"A bit disappointing.
Wasn't impressed
Earthquake simulator was hardly earthquacking
Hurricane Simulator was a huge disappointment!
Fun place for kids",3
Theme Park,I've already given a review and received a reply. No need to continue on this site.,3
Theme Park,Loved our first visit. Very disappointed as the entry staff said tons of characters out and we didn't see a single one. Great food at the diner by Ford store.,3
AZM,It was ok but a lot of empty animal homes and staff was rude,3
AZM,"Not bad, but u cannot see all animals , cause too far away for walk..

The smoke area's are also to far",3
Museum,Went to see the Tang Hall of China with my cousins from Shanghai. Video displays were completely out of order. Wifi audio site was down. Disappointing. Unacceptable.,3
Theme Park,Never a long line. Came for the pumpkin spice event. Most of the spots where u get the food and drink had no idea what it was and seemed very poorly organized. Paid extra to feed animals but they did not tell us it was closed so that was also a big letdown. Not sure if I'd come back.,3

Airport,"Priority Security Checkpoint was horrible would have been quicker using General Boarding.

Theme Park,We did the scary ride and it was pretty fun. The staff was not very friendly. Would not have done it if it didn't come with our ticket package though.,3
AZM,I was so looking forward to this zoo. ¬†It does not have a flow so you are back tracking a lot. ¬†I was hoping the train ride would give an over view but it is only a kiddie ride. ¬†Hoped to see Fiona but she was asleep. ¬†Will try again when I am in the area.,3
Theme Park,"It's nice, but I expected more for the price of it. It's ok to come here for the first time, but I would not come back...",3
Museum,Over rated. Just a little attraction for kids and youths.,3
Theme Park,"Beautiful view, good to visit, snack bar was less.  Staff not so friendly .For this cold weather no warm  drinks available.
Easy hike down .",3
Airport,Once again I was delayed on my return flight.  Delta said it was due to weather but the weather was fine when checked against my app.  Then they said there was a problem at the Minot airport.  I'm not sure what that means. Sounded kind of convenient for Delta.,3
Theme Park,"Nice, fun park but they need to hire more people to work their refreshment stands, all of them had extremely long lines to wait in. Nobody wants to come to an amusement park to spend a half hour in line to get a drink.",3
Airport,It is very spread out and is difficult to find anything. The airport could use some renovation to make it easier for consumers.,3
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Some are similar, some are not üôàüôà (Original)",3

AZM,Clean. Animals well kept. Not everything was open. Food very pricey. $5 for a bottle of soda. Lunch was $75 for 2 adults and 2 children. Staff was friendly and helpful.,3
Airport,Nothing fancy. Lines weren't too long for a Thursday morning.,3
Airport,Plane flew in with me and another picked me up,3
Museum,We didn't actually go in because it is for kids and you have to by the full tour package.,3
Museum,Good for the kids  but the tickets  are high  we spent 87.00 dollars  for 2 but if you go on this app GROUPON  YOU WILL SAVE MONEY,3
AZM,"no many exponents in museum, lot of local stars. MY ADVICE FOR YOU: You can buy online ticket to seaworld, and this ticket will be valid for 7 days for museum",3
Theme Park,I would give 5 stars if were not for the pricy parking + attractions. $20 parking + $15 per attraction,3
Airport,The lines are always long when going through TSA. But that's the world we live in now.,3
AZM,"Beautiful and well kept,  took a tiny truck trip around lol they gotta change their tour on that. Was very cheezy and even the little ones didn't pay attention",3

Aquarium,"Brrrr. Getting a bit chilly out there.

Se√±or Cinco seems to not mind tho.",3
Attraction,"The place is nice for for kids, and the themes are cool but one thing I don't like about it that every time we go, there are closed rides and they don't announce it in advance.

Definitely its a cool place to visit for one time only and not worth buying the season pass.",3
Museum,"It's a good museum, but maintenance and cleaning is horrible many interactive activities where broken, smelled horrible and lastly almost no hand sanitizer machines anywhere. Other than that it's was pretty good.",3
Aquarium,To expensive total worth it if you become a member only,3

Airport,My fave hassle free airport.  First time bad experience.  The shuttle driver was horrible.  He just dumped us at baggage claim instead of our departing airline.  We missed our flight as a result.  Thanks to the very excellent Southwest Airline associates we were able to get booked for the next flight out with no extra fee.,3
Museum,"Sure small for the price,  good for teens or couples ,wouldn't say toddlers tho . We had fun but just expected it to be more?",3
Aquarium,"Nice place but kinda small then I expected
Not many special fish",3
Airport,"Sky train needs security at night, power outlets at gates should be operational.",3
Attraction,Legoland is pretty cool if you have kids around 5 years old.  Otherwise the bricks are cool but rides are not for older kids.   10 and 11 is too old.,3
Airport,confusing to get around here but it's usually decent people just trying to catch a plane ....,3
AZM,"It is an ok place, if it is costing more than 25 SGD then do not go.",3
AZM,Good place to visit when you go to Thailand. Some of the figures look really original while some are not close at all. There was Putin photo at outside but I could not see his figure in the museum. Probably removed after the political trend. A bit pricy,3
AZM,Half of the animals were gone. The petting area consisted of 4 goats. The animals that were there were hiding and sleeping.,3
Aquarium,The aquarium was good but my baby brother had explosive diarrhea right when we parked so we had to clean it up. BTS was also playing nearby so there was so much traffic and in the aquarium there were so many cringe kpop stans. Love the penguins though,3
Airport,Quick trip to Atl from Phx. Had a quick bite and flight with Frontier. Busy airport and the security was a bit confusing. All in all was ok.,3
Aquarium,We had a üê≥ of a time today on our trip to Adventure Aquarium!,3
Theme Park,"Really cool place, we just did the 3D shooter game that they have, which was really fun. I think the prices are a bit too high for how short the game is, but it was still a fun time.",3
Airport,Give yourself more time than usual at this airport.  Walk to gate takes 30 min.,3
Airport,Huge airport but did have many places to eat or drink if you wanted to. Why are the connecting flights always on the other side of airport? Not great when you are in a rush but good when you have to hang out for your next flight.,3
AZM,Make sure to bring a credit card/debit card! No cash accepted at the park AT ALL,3
Museum,We're big space fans. This doesn't really hold up in comparison to the Space Center in Florida at Titusville. But it wasn't terrible. It's a good educational trip for your kids or if you're interested in NASA.,3
AZM,Hard to navigate if you don't visit frequently.  We got stuck in a line for an encounter that ended up not being exciting.,3
Aquarium,"I was repeatedly told that this is the worlds biggest aquarium until recently . I was slightly disappointed.

But if you just go as a causal outing with kids and family , it would be fun. I liked it",3

Airport,Airport is nice and clean. Getting to and from the car rental place from the international terminal is a  pain. Be prepared to add between 40 min and 1 hour to you trip just dealing with the shuttles and travel times and waiting for the pick of the vehicle.,3
Airport,I(L) have a soft spot for ATL's interconcourse indoor jungle ceiling. #airportlife,3

Airport,"Airport itself was fine but the signage for rental car return was sparse.  Many of the signs were at or so near the needed exits/roads we had to guess about our exit.  Fortunately, we were correct but it was a literal fork in the road with the only choice being left or right and NO signage.  FYI- go right.",3

Museum,"The OLD Wax Museum
Needs updated on some characters. Also could use more  movie stars or singers. Some of them were made years ago and they were hard to recognize the character. No signs by some of them I didn‚Äôt know who it was!",3
AZM,"Amazing place to go but unless you're white as hell with no taste, do not get the food. Sad, flavorless and even looks bland. Bring your own food !",3
Airport,It‚Äôs a PITA to get to Terminal 1 from TERMINAL 2.  Gotta take 2 train. 1 public metro and then another internal tram..,3
AZM,Very average theme park. Only good for taking photos. However not good for adults as most of the rides are for kids. There is only 1 rollercoaster which has the longest wait times. I would never go back again.,3
AZM,"Zoo itself is great! Animals, fantastic! Price of drinks/gifts outrageous! Normal size bottle of vitamin water, at Publix, $1,99. Here, $6.50! Are you kidding me!?!?!?!?!",3
Theme Park,"I would suggest a ticket for those who can't participate in the rides portion. I just went for the sights and shopping,",3
Theme Park,Confederate controversy aside it's really not that impressive an attraction. The view from the top is somewhat lackluster. You'd be better off driving to the blue ridge mountains.,3

Airport,"Very crowded as expected for Thanksgiving week. Chec ked in just fine. Got here early and planned on going to Atlanta lounge only to find out there would be a wait list of 45 minutes. This is the second time now. By the time I wait to get in,  there wouldn't be much time left before I'd have to go to my gate. Seems they are in need of an expansion.",3
Aquarium,"An okay experience
While an amazing facility, we found the exhibit variety lacking compared to other aquariums we‚Äôve visited.The central tank with the whale sharks, rays, and turtle is amazing (as is the shark tank) but past that the exhibits run short quickly.",3
Attraction,"Arrive ahead of opening hour (10am). Half an hour before or so, otherwise way later, avoid sharp 10am. Plan in advance and buy tickets before. Long lines, most of them without shade, take solar screen and water.",3
Aquarium,"We went on election day.  Very crowded.   It was lots of fun and the hippos came to perform for us after feeding time!  I would stay away from the cafeteria, however, over priced and employees not very helpful.",3
Theme Park,"One thing they don't tell you is that if the temperature gets down below 40 Fahrenheit they shut down several of the roller coasters. I understand this is probably for safety reasons, but it would have been nice to know before planning our trip. My 5 year old daughter was very disappointed.",3
Theme Park,The park was fun however wait times for food and drinks are horrible.  This park was not that busy on 11-5-22 and the waits sucked.,3
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Crowded on public holidays. For evening admission, some attractions end early, so check in advance! For evening admission, some attractions end early, so check in advance!",3
Theme Park,Beautiful place but rides took long and unfair for who had passed to get in ride quickly while people stand long hour to get ride that cost us expensive that is not worth for us and we will not come back again that place,3
Airport,The terminal is nice. One bad thing is that you can't really get a meal while you are waiting to be picked up from the airport. Only expensive snacks are available.,3

Airport,Thousands of travelers flock to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport one day before Thanksgiving,3
Theme Park,"I wish they wouldn't let so many people in. The lines for food were insane... Luckily we packed snacks, which I would recommend doing if you go.",3
Garden,The light show was awesome.  Several sites are closed. I thought the food in the 2 main restaurants  should have been better. We stayed in a cottage no daily room service and the towels and wash clothes had holes in them.,3
Airport,"Very well-designed and one of the biggest in the world. My only issue is 95% of the TSA officers are just plain rude for no reason. Rude people is a common theme in this airport (food service workers, store workers, & even gate agents.",3
Airport,Your curb entering the bathroom are a hazard to old people. It jerked my roller luggage out of my hand and before I knew what was going on I was doing a trip dance to keep from following my  luggage that was sprawled on the floor. Not a good idea unless flood control was the intent. This hazard need your attention.,3
AZM,High quality attraction. Unfortunately like the rest of the world short handed so all attractions inside were not open,3
Airport,"The seating is a$$, but helpful staff üëçüèª",3
Aquarium,"Definitely not worth the price of admission, plus parking. Although the sharks were definitely cool",3
Airport,No smoking room (sadly like most airports) they were able to handle a lot of people very quickly at tsa though. There were only a few options for food. But they were decent.,3

Airport,Got there too early and couldn't get into security waiting for airline staff to arrive. Not much outside of secure area in amenities. Advice. Don't arrive too early. Make sure your airline is staffed.,3
Museum,Was ok bit over priced for what it is üòï.. staff are nice .. some of the wax figures are on point some absolutely terrible üòû though the star trex figure is brilliant,3
Museum,"We are past COVID but I think they still need to be sanitizing rides and spraying down items. Rides that were enclosed should be sprayed when new people get in.
A lot of things to do.",3
Theme Park,Overpriced like crazy. Christmas lights are amazing!,3
AZM,"Nice new aquarium. It is a small aquarium and feels cramped inside, especially when busy. They have some fun exhibits for kids. I didn't see any big sharks like other aquariums.",3
Theme Park,"It was ok, personally the lines for the showers started forming a hour before they started, the lines for the rides weren't much better.",3
Museum,"Descent place, informational and educational but overrated in my opinion. In addition everything inside has price label and long lines. At least few activities should be part of the admission ticket price.",3
AZM,(Translated by Google) There are only 3 vehicles. 3 hours is enough,3
Airport,"Meh! Signage a problem as always, from getting to the car rental drop-off to the gate. Delta has now reduced baggage check-in for the passengers to do (do we get a price reduction for using our labor?) Staff friendly and helpful.",3
Theme Park,"Great place for families vacationing
Very beautiful place but a little pricey. I don't think anyone should be charged a full day price after purchasing tickets after lunch. I would go back and I enjoyed the experience ,but probably only for a big event",3
Airport,I'm not a fan of clear it supposed to save you time on line .. Not in Ga. I wanted on this line and was told next time try priority more than 1 person for checking,3
Theme Park,Dollywood is great. Most of the staff Espically the women for some reason were very rude and unfriendly. I couldn‚Äôt help but keep thinking as sweet as dolly is she would have been so disappointed in their rude behavior,3

Aquarium,"Nice place. They offer different movies to discover more about different animals, I watched the shark one. It was informative. There is a dolphin show, no a big fan of animal shows. It's uncertain how much they really help, and what they do for business.",3
Theme Park,"We had a good time. Do not expect to have a Disney experience because is not the same.
Pro: - great for small children

Con:

Airport,The airport is HUGE. It‚Äôs a good exercise,3
Theme Park,Its nice but literally got to ride TWO rides all day. It was EXTREMELY crowded and spending that much money for TWO rides was excessive. The rides are not worth $50/each. Very clean and friendly people though.,3
Museum,"Good to see many stuffs.  The tram trips are not so good. I wish they will have some experience kind of things, where you feel like riding on space shuttle and seeing the planets.",3
Attraction,My reason behind the 3 star would be because I was very unhappy about everything in the theme park being sold by debit Card rather than Cash.,3

Theme Park,Stayed at the Inn. Enjoyed the festivities from the memorial hall side. Refused to pay $35 just to see the show.,3
Airport,"Good food easy to get around, but a lazy police officer who don't want to be bother especially getting off the train going to baggage claim.",3
Airport,"So big, it's often difficult to figure out where to go. And TSA takes easily 2 hours now, so be prepared. I've missed flights and ruined vacations because this airport was so horribly managed. A mask mandate would help so much!",3

Museum,"Interesting, but there is only limited things you can do.",3

but expensive and to crowded.",3

Theme Park,"Probably a fun place for family outing. I seen advertising for the Christmas decor, it was nice but expensive for light display. The train ride was a let down, heard others say they would like a refund. Fun little place for an amusement park not so much for the light show.",3
Museum,"I hate businesses that don‚Äôt offer coat check. 
This place is cool otherwise but the humans who decided no coat check in the middle of winter in chicago are ridiculous & rude.",3
AZM,"be careful annual ticket has blockout days, so it‚Äôs better to get a membership",3
Airport,Super busy but still efficient. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because there's a lot of homeless people just walking around inside. I thought that was really weird.,3
Garden,"The Christmas light show was decent, but does not come close to the light show at Lake Lanier.",3
Theme Park,I have been coming to this park for years. They recently added new rides. Their bluegrass shows and festivals are not what they used to be.   It is so crowded it has taken away the feeling of a family friendly park. We won't be buying our annual season passes anymore.,3
Museum,Winter Wonderlights is nice yet hardly worth $25.00 admission price. My advice is skip it & go to McLaurens Farm,3
Airport,Customer service at Gate E32 was not the best. Other than that I would say a pleasant airport,3
Aquarium,"One of the best aquarium in US
Very good Aquarium to see. The side shows like dolphin shows are a waste of money. They show only for 20 min. There is also another show. Same case, not worth.",3
Theme Park,"Check crowd level before you go
Beautiful fall decorations. But park was overcrowded. Didnt ride anything due to wait lines for rides (including tram to and from parking lot) being extremely long. Enjoyed the John Anderson concert that was included in admission fee.",3
Garden,Nice place. Just barely worth the Trail of Lights ticket price in my opinion. Verizon didn't have cell connection so I recommend people download and offline map for navigating back home,3
Airport,It's a very busy airport... Good luck üòâüòé,3

Museum,"Kind of over priced! Yes it's in a tourist town, but wasn't really worth $30 per person. Some of the figures didn't even look like the real thing. It's a fun ""one time"" thing, but there is better stuff to see as well.",3
Airport,Pretty standard airport. One thing that I love is the nursing mother rooms. They're spacious and comfortable. The room was a little dirty and there is a lack of privacy but I prefer it to the mamava nursing pods.,3
AZM,"It was okay, our son ha fun, but most of the hands in exhibits were either closed or broken. We had never been there before and received no help or guidance from the employees except paying for our tickets",3
AZM,Had a good time but quite a few exhibits weren't working üòï.  Possibly due to staff shortages,3
AZM,Relatively inexpensive but only 60% of the equipment works.,3
AZM,Way too expensive. A lot of attractions don't work. Lazer tag was small and didn't work well. Overall needs a lot of improvement. Some working attractions were pretty cool.,3
AZM,The ropes course was terrific for the kids.  However many of the lower room exhibits were not functional (compared to last year).  They appeared to be under staffed and spoke mostly to bark out masking rules.,3
AZM,"All in a good day. It was slow so the lines were short, but handful of the attractions were not available.",3
AZM,"Brought the kids and like other reviews, the place is run down. They had fun but for $58 for me, my wife, and one kid (other was under 3 so he was free.) Alot of exhibits out of order or don't work properly. Not really worth it.",3
AZM,"Our kids enjoyed the exhibits that were open and working.  However, there were a lot of exhibits that were out of service or not working properly.  Better upkeep would make this place way better.",3
AZM,Ropes course is great.  Several of the rides are still good.  A lot of broken exhibits.  Most of the exhibits that use software really need updates.  The 3d experiences have to be a decade old.  You'd be happier with a VR headset... Just about the cost of admission.,3
AZM,Some of the figures doesn't match with real figures.Some are really good.,3
AZM,Fun place for older kids! Not many activities our 4 year old enjoyed or could do. We'll take her back in about 3 or 4 years and she'll love it!,3
AZM,"Seemed like about 1/4 of the exhibits or displays didn't work.  Zero masks by staff or guests but frequent hand sanitizer available.  Not worth the price for a 6year old who was not tall enough for several of the ""rides"".",3
AZM,Most of the exhibits were down. Would definitely ask what all is open before purchasing tickets.,3
AZM,"This place is slightly amusing, but the exhibit just isn't nearly long enough. And honestly, it's much more focused on the arcade like stuff than education and cool experiments.",3
AZM,(Translated by Google) Good place but the day I went several games were not working and they charge the same anyway (Original) Good place but the day I went several games were not working and they charge the same anyway,3
AZM,"Definitely recommend for kids over 8 years old.  Down side was they seemed understaffed and over crowded.  The snack bar was out of almost half of the options, gift shop was completely picked over.",3
AZM,Its a good place to go its just some of there attractions need work. I remember when everything was brand new. Why is there no maintenance going on,3
AZM,For all that it is it was a good visit. Unfortunately a lot of the interactives we're broken or not available. Still had a good adventure.,3
AZM,Interesting place for the kids.  Staff seem to be ready to go home and were not attentively or helpful.  Can of a let down especially for the price.,3
AZM,"The architecture is wonderful but it was our first time there and nobody gave us a tour,explanation, nothing.",3
AZM,"It's a cool place, but for the price, many of the inter active stations weren't working properly, or couldn't hear the monitor, I think it's a little expensive for a the things not working properly.",3
AZM,"Here on a school field trip,  construction and painting are taking place,  they have multiple areas under construction and roped off.  They can do this at night while no occupants.  Other than that we had fun and enjoyed ourselves.",3
AZM,"The kids had fun but there were quite a few things that were not operational. Customer Service here was very average, the place was understaffed, expect to wait in long lines.",3

AZM,"A little expensive, and if you are over 275 don't go as you won't be able to ride anything.",3
AZM,Overall it was a good experience. My only complaint/suggestion is Jasper at the ropes needs further training on how to do his job properly. His attitude and failure to give instruction  is not a good representation of Wonderworks.,3
AZM,(Translated by Google) Very pretty on the outside but the price seems very high to enter it! (Translated by Google) Very pretty on the outside but the price seems very high to enter it!,3
AZM,"It was okay, kids liked bubbles creation station, the interactive sand,  rope climbing, it is expensive so go early in the day so kids can do all the activities  to get your money's worth. Good for ages 5-9.",3
AZM,It‚Äôs a great place to go on a rainy day and waste $135 for 2 adults and 2 kids. Half the stuff didn‚Äôt even work. The best thing they have to offer is laser tag and ropes course. The space fury ride was fun but you have to spend more money to get a VIP ticket just to ride it once.,3
AZM,"The kids had fun here. There really is alot for them to do. As a parent, you can see what they did and how they make $. Genius business idea BTW!",3
AZM,Very fun and interactive place for kids and adult's. Some of the employees could use some training on being more polite and friendly. Also several machines were broken so overpriced tickets are not justified.,3
AZM,Too crowded so we left. They had several bday parties going on when we arrived.,3
AZM,Kid friendly and fun but not much fun. There is a simulated roller coaster (max weight of 250 combined for the 2 seater capsule....) and virtual monster truck ride but the biggest attraction was the appearance of the upside down building for me. It was cute.,3
Theme Park,Alot to see and do. Food was not that good. Some was terrible.  All in all fun day.,3
AZM,"Over all a cool place, staff was friendly except for the girls working the roller coaster simulator.  Some of the games were not working correctly, piano keys were broken, VR headset smelled really bad.",3
AZM,Outside it looks awesome. Inside is for small children. It is geared for small kids. Find discounts online.  It's a bit pricey at full price for teens or adults to have a handful of things to interact with.,3
AZM,"Not too many people, kid friendly. Snacks/drinks are VERY expensive though all in all $32 wasnt to bad price wise to make memories with my nieces and nephew! üôÇ",3
AZM,Too crowded. They over-sell admissions. My son had to wait a long time to see anything and wound up playing a few video games. Considering size of the venue line lengths are proportional to those found at Disney.,3
AZM,"Great fun but no COVID controls, if someone has COVID and you're in after them you've got it as everything you have to touch to interact with. Sanitising stations are around but no one used it",3
AZM,"Good assortment of exhibits, some educational. No capacity restrictions so was packed with families, and there are no places to sit around the busy arcade etc.",3
AZM,It was okay. The location in Myrtle Beach is a lot better.,3
AZM,If you think that inside everything is upside down you are wrong. Its a game room. It is not a Museum. Just in the ticket sale area you can see something upside down in the ceiling.,3
AZM,Nice place but at times parking is difficult to find nearby,3
AZM,"Sorry, is that we were only adults and the truth is that the place is to be enjoyed with children. thanks for answering.",3
AZM,"The place was interesting but rude workers, specifically the rope climb. You should keep in mind that not everyone has done a rope climb before. Rather than your curt tone, it should be more calming so that person doing climb is at ease.",3
AZM,Super crowded and several things were not working.  No staff in sight.  Sanitizer dispensers were mostly empty.  There were several camps/schools there when we came so was a bit of a nightmare.  The 4d movie was super cool.  Daughter really enjoyed ropes course too.,3
AZM,There are some parts that are fun but then there's a lot of unfun parts and they charge you 100 dollars for it if it were 50 dollars ok 100 nuuh so yeah,3
AZM,This place is cool but a little expensive for what they have inside. I went with my two daughters ages 12 & 13 and my husband. There‚Äôs not much to do for adults and my kids enjoyed a few of their rides and games.,3
AZM,"We didn't get the chance to visit inside, but we hope to next time we're in Orlando.",3
AZM,"Fun place, my only complaint is that you can get through it very quickly. There is not very much with the general admission. The longer and more involved attractions require additional purchase.",3
AZM,"Nice place, you can't make a museum out of everything.",3
AZM,I enjoyed my visit here. Went with about seven children which I believe made it more fun. We had pizza wings and fries they were okay but I felt could have been done better. No refills on the drinks. Thank you! üòáüíú Would I go back? I think so üòä,3
AZM,That's the house superman ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  was trying to save when the bad ones try to destroy it and it felt out of his hand üëÄ at least he tried,3
AZM,"The kids enjoyed themselves,  was very busy and expensive for what it was. Lasertag and rope course were better at the main event just down the road.",3
AZM,Sure it's fun but a lot of the attractions are broken or worn down..people let their kids run rampid so good luck getting to do anything right away.,3
AZM,(Translated by Google) I wanted more. It&#39;s more for kids (Original) I wanted more. It&#39;s more for kids,3
AZM,(Translated by Google) More for children and adolescents. (Original) More for children and adolescents.,3
AZM,"Good place bad service
It was cool. But workers work way too slow and move much too slow. Waited for 40 minutes in line for a drink and they move like sloths.",3
AZM,"It's an amazing building but all the stuff inside feels loosely slapped together. The biggest offense is the large amount of stuff that was not working, from the floor piano, the robot arm, and the astronaut gyroscope.

We still enjoyed the 360 motorbike and laser tag!",3
AZM,"It's fun for the kids, but honestly not worth the money. I'd give it 5 stars if it was only 15 to 20 per person.",3
AZM,It was just okay. May be better with a younger crowd. The concession stand on the 3rd floor only takes cards and the lady at the stand asked if she could keep our receipt to use as a grocery list. The receipt with our name and some cc info. Seemed a little strange.,3
AZM,This place was cool  My kids had a blast and I did too. But the food menu didnt have much and it was over priced. The staff was friendly.,3
AZM,"Elevators wasn't working, hot inside, just seemed like it would be better. 8$ for 3 waters!!! It just seemed like there wasn't much to do once you got inside. Lazer tag was fun. Just didn't seem to be what all the hype was about. Sorry guys. It's mediocre...",3
AZM,"Fun, but a bit crowded and understaffed making the wait times longer than they should be.",3
AZM,I don‚Äôt feel like it was worth the price point for tickets. There wasn‚Äôt a lot for our 2 year old to do and a few of the things he could do were broken. I would definitely recommend it to families with children ages 5 and up. My husband had the best time out of all of us.,3
AZM,We went in to see what kind of business it was. Wasn't what we expected but it was nice in there. We didn't have time to spend that long of a time in there because we were going out to Silver Dollar City to see the Christmas tree lights.,3
AZM,It was very intresting an amazing but the rides wasnt working at the time. So we didnt get the full experience,3
AZM,"Definitely not worth the price they charge! Multiple attractions were broke, terrible wait times for any of the big rides. Only one person was running the rock wall so it took an hour for five kids to go before mine which is how most ‚Äúfun‚Äù things were my kids still had fun though",3
AZM,It was a little underwhelming... more for little kids than teenagers and it was crowded. I believe they are a bit under staffed as well. Some neat stuff to do tho.,3
AZM,We were here in march of 2021 and really enjoyed it. We returned in march of 2022 and it wasn't the same. Lots of exhibits were out of order. Felt like going to the front desk and asking for a discount.,3
AZM,Good place for older kids. If you're little one isn't 40inches or taller they won't be able to ride any of the rides.,3
AZM,"It was fun! Some of the stations were broke & didn't work, it was hot (maybe air-conditioning issues), nice staff, & due to their special iy was worth the money spent.",3
AZM,"The kids enjoyed the activities but I do wish they played into the theme a bit more. The marketing on their website, the building, and the lobby makes it seem like it would be very different. For the most part, it is an ok children's museum.",3
AZM,"Half the interactive rides were down while here so that ruined a lot. The staff was nice at least. Pretty crowded which we knew it would be but just so many rude people. Not the businesses fault there just people being people. Overall was pretty fun, just wish more was not broken.",3
AZM,"It's a decent interactive play place, certainly in the just above average range.  Far more expensive than other attractions similar to this.  Disappointed is what comes to mind, we would rather have gone to an arcade because there wasn't anything that uniqueor special.",3
AZM,If you have been to any sort of children's museum then you can skip this attraction. It's very run down. Not worth the money we spent.,3
AZM,Overpriced. Kids had a good time though.. But  Beyond the Lense is more bang for the buck. Facility is clean well kept. Employees are helpful. But we left there feeling as though we were expecting a little more for the price we paid.,3
AZM,This place has the potential to be great but some of the interactive exhibits were not working. The staff wasn't helpful.  The guy running laser tag was friendly and laser tag was the best part of the day.,3
AZM,Several displays didn't work and the ride/3d movie gave us all whiplash. We all had back headaches afterwards.,3
AZM,"Didn't have kids with us
Lots of interactive things to do. They give a military / vet discount which was nice. We went without the kids so didn't find it as fun. If we had kids with us I think they would have LOVED it!  There were people everywhere!  It was packed!",3
AZM,"Fun but a lot doesn't work
It's an interesting place and we did have some fun but we were disappointed at how many things didn't work.  With what you charge, shouldn't you have a maintenance team that keeps the rides and activities working?",3
Attraction,I love the park and rides but majority of the staff are racist towards colors people mainly the young workers I will not be returning if your black And want to feel welcomed.. don‚Äôt do it!,3
Attraction,"Park is relatively small, with lots of attractions closed. One of the main roller coasters was down. Fortunately, this time of year (Dec mid week), the park is empty with almost no waits for rides. Can cover most of the park in 4-6 hours.",3

Attraction,Lots of rides down due to down season and lots of mini land displays were pretty worn out,3
Attraction,Nice park but we wait too long to take a ride and the ride too short,3
Airport,*Spirit Airlines....A better experience than it was abt 3/4 years ago. I will try them again in the future. Cost was good for my budget. The only thing I would suggest is dealing with the crowd at the door. The people getting off can't even get through.,3
AZM,I Feelnits a bit overpriced and where the shows will occur inside aquarium is not adequately clear but if you can let go paying higher price experience itself is highly recommended,3

Aquarium,It‚Äôs a beautiful aquarium to visit but VERY OVERCROWDED!!! Seems like they only care about money instead of safety,3
AZM,nice experience but you are forced to buy a ticket for Mme Tusseau museum. the fee for the family was then quite excessive and once you are there difficult to leave the place without inflicting sadness to the kids.,3
Airport,Haphazard feeling with a crazy amount of construction. It also wasn't clear that the atrium was outside the TSA area. I went all the way there per an electronic map guide for one of the only places open around 5:30 am.

AZM,Some wax models do not tally with the actual personality. Plus there aren't many.,3
Airport,Baggage took 45 minutes to start coming down the carousel in the customs area last night. We landed at 1830 and the luggage started at 1915. Crazy since we were the only people in the customs area. I guess the airport must really be short handed of baggage handlers. Maybe the airport needs to pay them more to work in those conditions outside.,3

Airport,3rd flight this year with an average security line time of 45 minutes.... need more recycling bins before the luggage/final security check. Water bottles were spreading all over the floor around the trash.,3
Airport,You need a better ingress/egress from your cell phone lot. We have been trying to get out of this lot for over 25 minutes and have only moved one car space due to the shortness of the green light back onto Airport Drive. This is ridiculous during high volume times like holidays.,3

AZM,Great zoo overall. Don't understand how they can charge full price on days where it's too cold to bring out a lot of the animals. A lot of the food and beverage options were also closed. Didn't seem right to charge full price for only getting to see 1/2 of the animals.,3
Museum,"The general pass exhibition is underwhelming for the price. The theater was mostly a waste of time, nothing special that you couldn't watch on YouTube.

Attraction,Suitable for families. Teenagers that seeks thrill is not recommended here.,3
Airport,"Saw it mostly from the tarmac. Terminal N, Gates C have great food choices.",3
Theme Park,"Ok, Great Place but needs more Stuff.  It's literally been the same thing for 20plus years.  Add more shops, rides, something.  Great for Teenagers but lines are to long because volume is to high and isn't enough Activities to spread volume out. Just my Honest Opinion üëç",3
Theme Park,"Do better
Pro:visual appeal/staff awesomeCon:my cleaning request ignored (3strains of hair on the shower/tub)",3
Aquarium,Honestly it's a great aquarium but not worth the price point when you compare to other attractions nearby. Consider the Museum Center in Cincinnati instead. Cost less to take my family there and had a better / longer day out. It's definitely a nice facility though.,3

Airport,I couldn't purchase or find a mask anywhere.,3
Aquarium,Been here a few times. Really like it except when it is busy.  Then the kids don't get to enjoy it.,3
Airport,"Not too bad for an international air port to get out of, might be different when I fly home.",3
Attraction,Only for kids less than 5 to 6 years and not for age above 10. Might be interesting for Lego lovers,3
Aquarium,"Its fine. Would have preferred something less commercial, tanks featuring natural habitats and not fake coral, etc. But a fun theme-parkesque experience for kids I guess. On the more expensive side.",3
Aquarium,"The food court food was too expensive.
I will suggest you bring your own snacks with you !",3

Aquarium,"A very cool attraction, but they let way too many people in at once, and the food is ridiculously overpriced, considering it cost 50 for a ticket and 12 for parking. While I had a good time, I couldn't help feeling like I got scammed. Atlanta could definitely make this experience more affordable.",3
AZM,Nice small park. Admission fee is too much for the experience and they also didn't allow outside food.,3
Airport,"It's ATL. It's an airport. That's, that's about it.",3
Museum,Zoo was boring. The pets exhibit wasn't as hands-on as I was expecting. Kids still had a good time.,3
Aquarium,My family and I have been here quite a few times. The place is clean. The exhibits are fun and we always have a great time!,3
Aquarium,I visited here sunday morning as early as possible because of reviewers' recommendations. It was nice but would be better to watch special shows that needed additional costs and reservation. We didn't have enough seats for reservation.,3
Theme Park,Used to be a great place. Now they won't turn the heater on it the pool and food at the buffet is low quality and terible. The atmosphere is good and the scenery is beautiful.  Great if you're going to Dollywood.  Just don't expect breakfast or any perks.,3
Aquarium,It's worth it for a first time thing but for the biggest aquarium in the U.S.A. they could of done better....2 much decor and not enough veiwing room with how crowed it was. This could of been a touch down but you guys fumbled it in the end zoneü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,3
Theme Park,"Wish we knew half of the park was shut down during winter break.
This park is perfect for ages 2 through 10. I don't think older kids would be much excited.",3
AZM,I would like to give more stars but many of the exhibits were not functioning.,3
AZM,Disappointed no animals were out at all just because it's cold doesn't mean there is an animal that could not have been out at 6:00 p.m.,3
Airport,"Intuitive layout allows fast connections between domestic and international terminals. Equally fast ""train."" Unfortunately there are relatively poor food choices, and cleanliness seems to be an issue in waiting areas",3
Airport,"Small, easy to access airport. With TSA pre check, quick security screening. Real negative of this airport is the free WiFi. It's so slow that it's useless. Had to tether to my phone to check email on my laptop. Three stars because internet was nonexistent. Bathrooms dirty.",3

Aquarium,"An Average Aquarium
If you've been to the Chicago aquarium, Monterey Bay, Long Beach or some of the other big aquariums, this will be just ok.  The whale exhibit is very good, as is the dolphin exhibit.  It was VERY noisy.  I expect with more kids it would be even worse.  Bring earplugs.",3
AZM,"It was not enough time until the closing time due to the open run. This was my first visit, and I came out after finishing the open run.",3
AZM,Look at that sunrise! A few projects from last year all across the USüî•,3
Museum,"Bad: Haunted house had no live actors. Price is too expensive for what is included.
Good: Mirror maze fun, and wax museum is okay. Half of the wax models were very good, the other half were not good.",3
Theme Park,"It was ok. The food was gross, and they seem to have a hard time loading and unloading rides.  But the kicker for me was a employee (Heather) at the safari ride screaming at kids and being so aggressive. I don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon.",3
AZM,The zoo was great except the cost of feeding the giraffes and food. The cost of $8 for 3 tiny pieces of lettuce would certainly limit the number of children enjoying the experience. Maybe that is the intent!,3
Airport,7pm several restaurants are already closed...,3
AZM,Expensive when so much is closed down.  I wouldn't waste my money unless I planned to get a year pass (which I intend to do).,3

My husband got pushed a few times, people running over my niece in a stroller, had to fight your way through people just to get out of the way, and so much more.  Georgia aquarium was a one time thing for me, not worth it to go through that.",3
Museum,"Mostly for kids, unless you are making a reservation for the tours",3
Theme Park,"I'm sure it's much better when it's ""open"". They charged full price for parking when almost everything is closed. We had to really work at it to even find a place to see the carving. It did look like several people were using it as a walking park.",3
Museum,"2 PAC looked just to dam real,but wait let's not forget ,Snoop & EM",3

Aquarium,Really packed in all the places to look at the fish. But everyone was nice.,3

Airport,"For one of the worlds most busiest airports, customer service centers leave a lot to be desired. In particular on deltas front, where they are just simply hands off unhelpful, would rather get back to chatting with coworkers.

Meanwhile the gate agents are a shining example of actual customer service professionals",3
AZM,"Quite expensive for the experience. You can spend an hour there. If you have kid, it is a good place. If not, i think you can skip it.",3

Aquarium,"Very nice experience, but only two elevators for the amount of people they receive.",3
AZM,The children enjoyed the visit. I was not impressed.,3
Airport,Dirty and dated. Easy to navigate around the airport. Entire D wing has relatively zero heat. It was freezing even with a coat.,3
Theme Park,"The place is GREAT, the light shows are awesome and all the lights are just beautiful, HOWEVER‚Ä¶ PLEASE turn down the music in the little village. You all have speakers every few feet and it‚Äôs seems like you can‚Äôt get away from the ridiculously loud music.",3

Airport,"Always under  construction but finally overhead roof for departure and arrival drop offs are finally finished. It keeps the rain off of you and the hot sun. They change the lights according to whatever is going on in the city. Christmas lights, Fourth of July, etc..",3

Aquarium,Great experience for the children. Horrible parking. Get there early.,3

AZM,Old facility. Just ok; not bad not good. Would make it 4 stars if tickets were a little bit cheaper,3
AZM,Somewhat overpriced and they give the illusion of having a bigger facility than actual by providing views of the same tank from different angles.,3
Aquarium,From what we were able to view it was ok !!!! Wish we could‚Äôve seen more .,3
Aquarium,"nice aquarium but too expensive for its size
This is a nice aquarium but not very large. Too expensive considering there is not that much to see.  My granddaugher loved the eagle, and we all love seeing the otters.",3
Aquarium,"Typical Aquarium
The South Carolina Aquarium is in a really beautiful building right on the river. The exhibits are fine, but a fairly typical. Nothing spectacular or unique. Great for young children. It's a little pricey for what you get.",3
Aquarium,"Good for small children
The aquarium was geared to children under 10.  Many interactive displays.  We have visited aquariums across the US and was disappointed with amount of exhibits for adults.  Very crowded with strollers.",3
Aquarium,"Nice but small aquarium
Nice aquarium, but for the price there weren't many exhibits.  We really enjoyed the sea turtle and the sea turtle hospital.  The childrens area was extremely crowded, but hey...it's summer.",3
Aquarium,"Nice little aquarium
I always enjoy going to aquariums.  I did enjoy the outdoor touch tank and the outdoor marshlands. This aquarium is a little in the small side, but was still enjoyable.  We were able leisurely walk the entire bldg in just over an hour.  Was still very nice.",3
Aquarium,"Save your money
Not on par with Atlanta or Chattanooga. $70 for 2.  The facility is clean and the staff is nice but you can see the whole yhing in an hour.",3
Aquarium,"Pricey for the size
A very small aquarium, probably not worth the price of admission unless you consider you are helping save the sea turtles. Can be done in less than 2 hours. Very child-friendly, though. Lots of interactive exhibits and, again, not very big.",3

Aquarium,I love the Ga Aquarium. It's not super expensive and if you're there early on a weekday. There's not a ton of people. The views are crazy and all of the sea life everywhere. I recommend spending a half day walking around and getting lost under the sea.,3
Airport,"Very crowded.  The Marta train is little old.  Very convenient to the Marriott hotel. I gave a 5 starts due to the employees were very helpful. I lost my phone at the ladies restroom, but the employees helped me to find it.  I was very lucky. Thanks to the Good Samaritan turn it in!",3
Airport,"Oh, Atlanta International, what can I say.
As a avid traveler, I do my best to avoid flying in and out of here. Though I must say that when I do its never as bad as I thought. The train is easy to navigate to get to different terminals. The chairs could be better in terminal E.",3
Airport,"Very large airport that is all spread out. You have to use the train between terminals or you won't get there.

Do not make short layovers here unless you can somehow guarantee you don't have to move between terminals.",3
Airport,"MSP airport is relatively clean, efficient and friendly. Relatively quick line ups and turn arounds. Soft recommendation",3
Airport,Huge airport.  Subway train to connect to all terminals or walk on the underground walkway.  Lots of shopping and restaurants.  The priority plus lounge was very small and untidy with old worn-out furniture.,3
Museum,Everything as advertised...except it needs lots of updating and less exhibits closed.  We took our six year old grandson and it was a perfect outing for his age.,3
Zoo,I mean not bad for utah for sure.. wish was a little bigger with more animals but still enjoyable,3
Airport,The trains almost hurt my sister,3
Theme Park,Fun. Smaller than I thought.  No covered area for our school group to eat and it rained on us.,3
Aquarium,Wasn't bad but not worth 50 bucks but i understand why,3
Theme Park,If you visit often purchase a years pass. Cost covets 2 visits,3
AZM,Good! But the ticket is not too cheap for approx. 1 hour walk,3
Airport,A large place...you have to leave 3-4 hours early to catch your flight,3

Airport,"It's a massive airport. Honestly if I had to connect flights here I would give it at least an hour to connect flights, it's that large. They have food options and stores for snacking purposes and such but they are usually clumped at the central point and not spread out very much through out the entire terminal.",3
Theme Park,Well I visited in second week of Jan. It was windy and so the sky ride was closed. Couldn‚Äôt do much other than just viewing the  mountain. Though all attractions were closed  you need to pay the entrance fee.,3
AZM,"Nice zoo, been there many times however it‚Äôs really showing it‚Äôs age. Entrance fee has gone up but I don‚Äôt see any real change in the park itself. Most like won‚Äôt go back until there is some real change in attractions and general repair of the zoo itself.",3

Not much to do or see so i wouldnt go there too early. Good thing is not much walking.",3

Attraction,"Pretty decent place
Plenty of rides for smaller kids. Not too many for little kids. I'd recommend a cheaper photo pass as I think so many pass it up because it's so much. The stores are great, and I hope you find something about miniland usa, because so many just walk by it.",3

I got a cab super quick but a 10 mile ride was $45. That was a little steep from what I've been paying.",3
Airport,Would have been 5 out of 5 but riding the tram made me nauseous,3
AZM,Nice place but I‚Äôd like to see more variety. Was a bit disappointed that there are no jellyfish,3
Aquarium,Aquarium was amazing! The parking ramp attached to the aquarium is a nightmare!! Don't park in here. It took us 1.5 hours to get out of it.,3
AZM,"The buildings amazing, everything is so cool. The only problem was we were out of there in less than 30 minutes. We took our very precious time to look at everything, it was pretty expensive for what they offer.",3
Airport,The shuttle services from and to anywhere are not really reliable. Waiting 50min for a shuttle that should go every 15 from car rental to international is really not a good sign,3
Zoo,The food carts seem to be closed.  Lots of people bring their own pinics.,3

Museum,It was really great for the kids and very hands on! And honestly not that bad prices either,3
Theme Park,"I'm guessing because it was February that was the reason for most things being closed. Pretty clean park, but no real wow factor.",3
Museum,It's was fine place. But way WAY overpriced. I played extra for life and death wing and there where just questions about it. And more skeletons..,3
Airport,"There have been some improvements over the past few years such as a refurbished Terminal A and onsite rental cars, but the airport is still posted. It's also very crowded in the check-in areas due to a lack of space and the security area is also quite cramped.",3
Airport,It's ok... the terminal is nice but the gates are dingy and not enough seating for passengers,3

In 2019, the airport served over 110 million passengers, making it the first airport to ever surpass the 100 million passenger mark in a single year. The airport is a major hub for Delta Airlines, and it has been the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic since 1998.",3
Airport,Airport is nice but the security lines are ridiculous. You think they would properly staff the TSA lanes. Also layout makes you walk unreasonably long routes because they have so many closed areas and a crazy queue system. Just give yourself plenty of time.,3
AZM,Have you gotten your season pass for Kentucky Kingdom yet? They have a few different options to choose from this year! ,3
Zoo,Love the Denver Zoo but the middle of a cold winter day is not a good time to go. Lots and lots of construction right now. Wait for summer.,3
Attraction,"Its ok, fun, but not crazy fun. Kids between 4 and maybe 10 would really enjoy it. Not that many rides, a bit outdated and very expenssive (entry).",3
Attraction,"Legoland is just meh. The rides are slightly better than a carnival. I don't see kids older than 5 or 6 having a good time. Besides the roller coaster, most of the attractions were not entertaining to my 10 year old. Legoland might be worth visiting once, but but definitely not coming back.",3

The park was very well themed and was a good time.  If I look at it critically, though, it was a themed county fair set up in a hot parking lot with no shade.",3
Museum,It was OK. Lots for kids to do. They're remodeling some stuff and some things don't work as they should.,3
Aquarium,Always fun just way too crowded if you go on the weekend and the dolphin show was not worth waiting for. Choose sea lion show instead!,3
Theme Park,Probably needed to buy tickets in advance paid 381 for 3 felt ripped off.  If tickets at 89$ would be a better price for single park visit.,3
Theme Park,"Decent time w/ some fun rides but the price point is outrageous for what they offer.

AZM,"Tiring
Yes we visited the Tampa Zoo, it was not as elaborate as the tv series portrays. $48 per person was definitely a pricey admission and our day trip was accompanied by thousands of other patrons.",3
AZM,Love this zoo. My only complaint is there aren't more places to fill the souvenir cups!,3

Airport,Decent lines today approx 25 min to get thru security but according to staff this is the best it is time wise because usually its much longer to the point where people miss their flights so make sure especially on Sundays and weekends as it takes much longer time,3
Airport,"Not the worst place to spend a 7 hour layover, but could use a kids area. I don't understand why a large airport like JFK doesn't have interconnected terminals after security, or why there aren't play areas in each terminal. There's only so much walking one can do to keep the children entertained.",3
Aquarium,Too many people enjoy the aquarium.  They definitely shouldn't book field trips at the same day and time as general public. Made the experience horrible,3
Airport,You have to guess which baggage claim you're at until the last minute.  Seems like the last modernization of the layout was about 1983.,3

Garden,Check in at 4:00PM and room not ready! Stepped outside my room before checkout and returned I was locked out at 11:00AM sharp!,3

Aquarium,best place to for kids during winters...no dolphins or sea lions at this place and expect no shows.....hippos are great.....,3
Museum,"Interesting place to visit
We visited on moon towards festival, and it was extremely crowded, everything was not available to do. We did enjoy walking around and seeing the exhibits and the live music.",3
Theme Park,There should be a discount price for grandparents who don't use any facilities,3
AZM,"Very crowded, doesn't feel clean or smell very good. Lots of things to do, kids enjoyed it.",3
Aquarium,What do you do when it's unseasonably cold? Double down and head north. ü•∂,3
Zoo,We got there before it got busy and got through the whole park before it got crowded. All that without rising through any of the exhibits,3
Aquarium,The dolphin show and the movie are pretty short. It would be nicer if they have longer shows.,3
Airport,Busy. But security moves at a reasonable pace and there are a lot of options to eat and or shop,3
Aquarium,Honestly I was slightly disappointed. I have been to aquariums all over the US and thought this would be the best. It's very overcrowded and we didn't have a pleasant experience. The aquarium in Gatlinburg is actually better despite being smaller.,3
Theme Park,Nice park but went on a cold day over spring break. Didn't know that only 2 rides would be running til the temperatures warmed up to almost 40. Would only go again on a warmer day.,3
AZM,Quite underwhelming unless one is a fan of Bollywood. Access is a bit confusing due to the construction work went I went.,3
Airport,A lot of construction going on. Thought it was going to be a mess to deal with but it wasn't bad.,3
Theme Park,"It used to be amazing fun for all of us, especially the kids.  The last two times we have been multiple rides were closed and some of the ones that were open were not running at full capacity.",3
Museum,Was really cool but nothing for little kids other then the bubbles,3
Airport,(Translated by Google) I want to smoke while waiting (Original),3
Theme Park,"We stopped at the bakery in Dollywood, The cinnamon roll was dry and hard it wasn't a freshly baked it was a day old and that was like $6 plus ridiculous I had to toss it out it wasn't worth eating",3
Museum,Inspiring place!  It's very crowded and needs to improve for health concern.,3
AZM,A quicker experience than we were expecting for the price.,3
AZM,I think it‚Äôs overpriced for what you get but it‚Äôs okay for the kids,3
Aquarium,It's okay you pay a lot for a little . There IS a Hammer head shark!,3
Aquarium,It was cool but pricey and small.It‚Äôs more fun for younger kids.,3
Aquarium,"This was a nice aquarium, there was a beautiful Eagle at the top floor right when you get off the elevator! Wish there were more fish on the first floor though, kind of empty down there",3
Aquarium,"Way too expensive for how small it is. It is quality, but i kept looking for more and simply didn‚Äôt find any. Not worth it unless you have small children(they can touch the sting rays and play on the childrens area)",3
Aquarium,It's a nice little aquarium that is very oriented towards young children. Probably would have had a great time with my grand children.,3
Aquarium,"This is was a pretty fun experience, but would probably be more enjoyable with children ‚Äî lots of kids activities and hands on things. A little pricy for the amount of time we spent there.",3
Aquarium,Kinda small and super expensive. The exbits were cool though.,3
Aquarium,Not worth the price honestly. We were done within 30 mins. The coolest part was the sea turtle hospital.,3
Aquarium,If you have been to Atlanta or San Francisco... Nit worth to go there... If you have never seen anything... It is okay... For kids a win... BR,3
Aquarium,Not horrible but not somewhere I could go to often. Nothing really ever changes.,3
Aquarium,Not a great value. I live I Norfolk and it's Aquarium has a lot more to offer. Does not take much time to get through SC Aquarium.,3
Aquarium,"Nice for giving the kiddos something to do, surprisingly small. It's no ATL acquarium, but it's ok",3
Aquarium,Smaller aquarium and so I thought it was over priced for what it is. But the displays were good and wasn't to crowded,3
Aquarium,Great aquarium but quite costly. Charging almost $30 for a three year old is excessive. You can't take your child there for less than $60 in just entry fees for you and them.,3
Aquarium,It's mediocre could have been a little bit better being it's the only aquarium South Carolina have I believe that is why people go to Georgia instead with the tax money we South Carolinians pay use it to do some expanding.,3
Aquarium,"It's a nice aquarium with some really cool animals, it's just not as big as I expected it to be for the price that they charge for admission.",3
Aquarium,Very average aquarium but I'm from Florida so hard to compare.,3
Aquarium,"It was $35 per adult.
Ok aquarium but not worth $35 tho. Maybe $20 or $25. But decent overall.

Only had 3ish floors. There were also rescued animals, bald eagle, sea turtle without a fin etc.
Got to pet and feed rays, paid $5 extra for 3 pieces of fish for the feeding.",3
Aquarium,"Spent abt an hr here, it was ok. Not very big so I didn‚Äôt think it was as much to see compared to other ones I‚Äôve been to. But great way to beat the heat for awhile.",3
Aquarium,"It is very small aquarium. Ticket cost is expensive for what you get to experience. Only good thing was that, there were not many people so was able to look at everything without waiting for other people to move. We were able to look at everything in about 30min.",3
Aquarium,"For the money, this aquarium was average at best.  But what was really surprising was the 10 inch rat running down the hallway close to the bald eagle.  I'm sure it didn't escape from an exhibit. Please beware.",3
Aquarium,Nice but too expensive for what it is go to myrtle Beach,3
Aquarium,"Nice aquarium. Not super big. Takes all of an hour at most when visiting here. Great stop if you need to fill a small amount of time before or after a trip to Fort Sumter or a cruise around the harbor.
The sea turtle rescue and touch pools are the highlights.",3
Aquarium,I expected more for the price payed . But a few really nice thing things in there .,3
Aquarium,"Nice to see all the different animals and fish, too many single animals, makes it a sad sight.  Need to bring in more rescued animals only.",3
Museum,Fun experience and kids enjoyed it. It was hard to figure out where to go and what to do though. We waited for the Red Tram and felt like it wasted a ton of time for us to look around at other things. Artifacts were cool to geek out at though.,3
AZM,(Translated by Google) Great for families. But even without children you can look at it beautifully (Original) Great for families. But even without children you can look at it beautifully,3
Museum,Love this place! Y'all do not ever answer the phone though?? Wait time should be a thing if your going to leave customers on hold for more than 10 min. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,3
Aquarium,"(Translated by Google) The price seems a bit excessive, especially when you have a one-year-old baby and they charge you a ticket ..... (Original) The price seems a bit excessive especially when you carry a baby of a year and they charge you a ticket .....",3
Airport,Warning!! Only for Delta international check-in. All other airlines for international check-in at domestic terminal.,3
Aquarium,Good place. Can be a lot of people choose a good time. Extremely expensive.,3
AZM,"It's a one time see kind of place, wax celebrity in a dark museum.. if you have got time on your hands then sure or you can skip it",3
Airport,"Better than some though the biggest issue I have with it is something I think they are trying to fix, is the TSA line for non pre check. When I went there was about a 45 min line, with 3 agents checking IDs and lines open with about 20 agents  just standing there.",3
Airport,It's huge!! Be prepared to walk a distance from terminal to exit.,3
AZM,Online booking system would not work on my device or my wife‚Äôs device. Booking at least a day in advance is much cheaper. Best for children over 90cm tall as a number of rides and activities do not allow shorter children.,3
Theme Park,The  lines are usually really long for rides & food &  that takes away from enjoying it as much like any park I suppose in my opinion. If you have a big family it‚Äôs a little harder to enjoy do to everything is so expensive. I Wish there was a discount for people who live  a hour away,3
Museum,Its okay to go once. Unless you are really into rockets and space,3
Theme Park,"Park is dated but a good time. Majority of staff is very inexperienced. Park was not busy but food, drink items, and supplies were missing.",3
Theme Park,"I was surprised at how hyped up this place was. I was expecting a lot more for almost $100 a ticket. Most of the rides for our 4 year old were similar to ones at a fair or the island for way cheaper. The food was fast food like, and there were long walks between attractions with little in between.",3
AZM,"Palm Desert with the Grady family! üçªü¶íüçÄ

Sports,"Busy weekend
1. 1st college visit, Kennesaw State University 
2. College football hall of fame
3. Monster minigolf
4. 7v7 Dirty South Tournament
5. Top Golf",3
Theme Park,"Parking $25.. Cable Car Round Trip $20+Tax...
I think that is too much for the cable car. It used to be $10 for Round Trip and $6 for one way and no parking fee",3
Aquarium,Very few large viewing windows for the shark tank. Other tanks were quite small. Felt less like an aquarium and more like a zoo,3
AZM,"It was okay. The kids had fun and many time it was very loud. The food there is a little pricey for what you get. Some of the staff was not very helpful, a few of them even seemed annoyed with you asking questions.",3
Aquarium,"3.5?
I used to like this place better when I went many many years ago but now I feel like it's not really operating at the same level as the past. It kind of felt like there were more frogs there than fish when I went recently. Also, not sure why but octopus and some other tanks were missing.",3
Theme Park,"$20 just to enter and park. Some attractions are included,  others available- additional cost. CHECK WEATHER BEFORE GOING.",3
Aquarium,"It's a good place with lots of beautiful exhibits. However, the tickets are pricey for what they offered. Kids are not free. We are from Melbourne, Australia where kids are often offered free entry to many public exhibits and zoos, and the tickets are much less pricey.",3
Museum,"Its good for the people who have interest, but for general public, I believe its gets boring. Also, the tram tour is more than an hour long which was too much for us.",3
Museum,"Was fun when we first got there there was only a few other people, after about an hour it was packed, and it's not much fun waiting in lines and maneuvering through crowds ( and it's off season !)",3
Theme Park,"Was very expensive, very small park, but it was great to see Dolly herself during the parade",3
Airport,"Clean, busy, noisy, reasonably efficient. Nothing badly broken. Live piano in Terminal E food court!",3
Aquarium,the museums were cool but rap god karaoke at midnight at the hotel topped it off,3
Theme Park,"Much of the park wasn't open yet.  No animals except a single pony, the train wasn't running, and loads of the craftsman locations weren't staffed.
We had fun but I think next time we will go after April.",3
Aquarium,"FISH!! Disappointed in the lack of mermaids, but... ‚ÄçCan't see the dolphins without an additional ticket. The sharks are cool. As are the penguins and otters and rays and... Be prepared for children.",3
Theme Park,"The guy at the front desk was super friendly. The maze itself is pretty cool. I just wish for the price you pay, it would include going multiple times or something. Short and not really worth the money you pay.",3
Theme Park,Crowded. Hour and a half waits on a cold rainy day.,3
Museum,"Although interesting, it's also a little bit boring, the tour was read from a script and you don't really get to see much.  If you're a space geek, it'll be good, but if not...",3
Aquarium,Is good aquarium but they dont offer senior discounts üëé,3
Airport,Busier than ever but ugh üò´ here we are,3
AZM,"A little recap of our trip to the zootampa

#zoo #zootampa #tampa #florida #familytrip",3
Theme Park,The tram was slow. Multiple rides were closed even though it was a beautiful 80 degree day. Hopefully it's better later in the season. Last year was amazing!,3
Museum,"It was an okay experience. Very crowded on a Sunday. Compared to Houston's museum, it was slightly underwhelming. They have separate exhibits that cost, in my opinion, should be included in general admission like Houston. Parking was terrible also.",3
Airport,"Security was good, ticket agents great (Turkish Airlines). Food service was terrible. They were out of everything and very slow.",3
Airport,"The workers are rude as heck. Out of the 5 I had to speak to only 1 was nice. They hate their jobs. I get it, some people are dumb, but no reason to be a d*ck head to everyone else. I rated 4 stars because it's a really nice looking airport. It's giant. Easy to read directions.",3
Theme Park,This park is good if you have young children (4-7). Older kids may find this park boring.,3
Aquarium,Very small aquarium. Very expensive. Spent almost $45 on a single day pass for an adult. The aquarium can be finished in less than an hour even with reading all the information on the graphics displayed. I miss when they had more interactive exhibits and the 4D theatre.,3
Zoo,"A little pricey, and a lot of things were unavailable. I figure the summer would be vibrant.",3
Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport how is the rush at international delta priority check in these days especially with spring break? Last year 3 hours weren‚Äôt enough to get checked in and through the security!,3
Museum,"Very interesting however, it‚Äôs very expensive ($30 pp), to visit the Apollo Mission Control is an extra $15, and add $10 for parking. , booking the tram tours is nearly impossible l, the app took my reservation request then rejected it‚Ä¶ lame.
Staff seems knowledgeable",3
Airport,It's an airport.  Hurry up and wait in line.,3
Theme Park,"Rides were fun, but expensive being you for parking then pay for admission, and the food was cold.",3
Aquarium,Beautiful. Shame that various attractions were not available as they were under maintenance,3
Attraction,"Please improve your service
Hot room,, thermostat problem. Late room service, Staff is professional, be little polite with little smile. Thank you for compensation for your problems",3
Airport,Average looking airport in need of some updates and upgrades. Its layout is confusing and not well planned out. If you are not up for a long hike to get to your gate may I suggest getting a wheelchair.,3
Theme Park,"$20 for entrance fee. Do not accept state park permit???
Not in GA?
Anyway good location and best hiking course,biking, etc...
Totally  5 hiking course. But only Sat,Fri and Sunday open it.
7 ays open course is only top of the mountain course.",3
Airport,Like all airports it is crowded and overpriced,3
Museum,The first thing I noticed is that the line was very long . they don't have the right look for some statues. The last thing I noticed is the store only had the Hollywood sign and only some of the statue stuff,3
Aquarium,"A bit of a disappointing aquarium to be honest. Admission was super pricey for an experience that was way too short. There's lots of hands-on activities for younger kids, and lots of awareness of pollutants for the kiddos, but it was overall very underwhelming.",3
Theme Park,Fun place for the kids. Not to happy they took away the Free Active Military Service member Entrance.  I use to take my family often now I will go maybe once a year,3
Attraction,"A park for small but seriously small, a pleasant experience, but I think about going back, I prefer to visit another park",3
AZM,they need to rename that poor elephant named after Marge Schott,3
Aquarium,"It's a nice place. But saw everything in an hour. Reviews said 3 to 4. Also way to many people started to show up, couldn't breath...... To packed in there hardly room to maneuver around and walk forward. Pretty disappointing for the $300 I waisted",3
AZM,Had a fun day Thursday Mar 30 overall but disappointment with no bears the bears at zoos are always some of my favorites and various other enclosures empty or animals not out example meerkat and cheetah.,3
Museum,"It's kinda fun, but honestly it's over priced and if you aren't a local I wouldn't say it's worth the money. There a plenty of other places you can take your kids for similar prices that are MUCH better.",3
AZM,"It was not too expensive, but the exhibit was a little underwhelming. Would be more fun if you had young kids to bring with you. It's not as fun for adults, in my opinion.",3
Airport,"Quite busy as to be expected, however when flying from Hartsfield give your self 3.5- 4 hours of cushioning with your time of ""boarding"" not your flight departure time!",3
Airport,"The signage is not great, if unfamiliar with the airport, but otherwise ok",3
Museum,(Translated by Google) Many things to discover but the organization and presentation are not up to the place. Even in the restoration. (Translated by Google) Many things to discover but the organization and presentation are not up to the place. Even in the restoration.,3
AZM,You have to pay to feed the giraffes  by appts only. Really bummed.,3
Zoo,Small zoo that can be done in a couple hours. The polar bears and one aquarium is off exhibit until 2024.,3
Airport,"Customs was very quick, so fast my passport didn't even leave my fingertips before it was given back.  My bags sadly didn't make my connecting flight even though they had almost an hour and the flight was late boarding.  The plane train is very bumpy and a bit of a chaotic mess with people coming on late and delaying the train for everyone.  Please don't block those doors.",3
Airport,It'd be great if Delta could get their flight on time in Atlanta...I do all I can to avoid Atlanta...DFW is much better for layovers...,3
Airport,"This time our immigration was a long, long, line. More than an hour in order to see an immigration officer. Would have been good idea if at least in this situation as a courtesy, they provide water, specially because of the many children that were there.
Staff tried their best, but this decisions come from higher places.",3
Airport,When coming through the international terminal they need more customs agents on duty. We had to wait in line over 2 hours to get back into the country,3
Museum,We have been going here for years now. It needs some updates and showcase some current space technology.,3
Aquarium,"It took us over an hour to get parked and we had to jump out and run so we wouldn't miss our time slot. It was still packed even with the time slots. I did enjoy the sea lion show.  The aquarium is nice but they need think about parking, it was insane.",3
Theme Park,Very few things actually about Dolly. The whole park is kitchy shops and like 5 roller coasters.,3
AZM,"It's definitely a beautiful aquarium. I just wish there was more to it because I was sad it was over so quickly. Looking from the outside, I thought it was huge!",3
AZM,If you wondering how clean the water on the spray ground might be,3
Theme Park,"Nice park to walk around , mostly carnival food.. Kids did a couple coaters, some closed for maintenance‚Ä¶ thought there world be more up beat live music ‚Ä¶ price tag  high for this park.. but I‚Äôm glad we checked it out .made memories",3
Airport,BUSY BUSY BUSY. Get there as early as possible.,3
Airport,The largest Airport in the world should have more attendants and kiosks for Clear/TSA Pre-Check.,3
Museum,It's cool the wax figures all that pretty lifelike liked the horror section just a bit upset we couldn't go to the top and touch the monkeys nipple like my sister because of covid I feel we should have gotten half off for not being able to go up there quite annoying,3
AZM,"I don't think, amusement park is in the right category still a cool place for the kids.",3
Museum,Good/Great Experience BUT***Downside: ¬†You need to take better care of the attractions. They're old and Dirty - SHOW SOME PRIDE - start by power washing the Rockets,3
Zoo,Busy than usual but its a great place for the kiddos.. food prices and quality wasnt worth it though.,3
Airport,Didn't see much. Running from one terminal to the other.,3
Aquarium,"First time comes to Atlanta to this Aquarium, it was ok , not the best, very very crowded, hard to get to parking with all the traffic of Atlanta, but I guess it's to be expected in a busy city, but never again, Ripley in Gatlinburg was so much better to us.",3
Aquarium,The aquarium was really cool however it was way over crowed making the experience much less favorable,3
AZM,Definitely not as good as I thought it would be. Mediocre at best. Lots of the exhibit didn't work correctly and the 3 rd floor is currently closed! We had fun but probably won't be back our science center in Springfield is way better,3
Museum,Been to a ton of wax museums.  This one is OK.  A bit pricey yet we all had fun.,3
Aquarium,The fish were really cool to watch. The crowds were insane even on a Monday and the music was way too loud. felt more like a mall with fish than an aquarium,3
