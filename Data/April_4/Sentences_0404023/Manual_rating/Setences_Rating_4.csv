Airport,"Very clean, needs people conveyors. Long walk from A1 - A-34.",4
Airport,"Fly out of this airport constantly & there‚Äôs some pros and some cons.

Pros- usually not crowded so that‚Äôs always a plus. Lines aren‚Äôt usually long and tsa goes smoothly.

Cons- the food/restaurants are nothing special. Service sucks & food is subpar that comes out messy, cold, wrong, and of course- overpriced.",4
Airport,Good experience. Busy as usual but I felt safe and everyone was following social distancing and no delays. Good day,4
Airport,"All the TSA employees i meet today were very good.
Always extremely confusing to fly international and over nite at hotel.

Hotels have free shuttles back to domestic but they do not have them to international.

Our group had eight dive bags, it took 4 phone calls, 2 to the owner of the transportation company, so they under stood we wanted big van an only go to the international terminal",4
Airport,"No issue getting around the airport and the gate to gate Subway line proved useful.
Another stop in ATL. It's huge so a busy time is accommodated and doesn't feel too crowded. It's really a decent airport experience",4
Airport,It's really big but you can get around using the tram.  It could use some people movers.,4
Airport,"After a long flight with a connection, it's nice to be able to take a walk to the other gates, and stretch your legs, also lots of good restaurants to choose from",4
Airport,"Who knew that little ol' SMF would have the glow up it did. It has Clear, an Amex lounge, and a super efficient TSA set up. Because of work I'm at this airport weekly, mainly terminal B. The ONLY thing I would say is a bummer is the food options and the lack of good coffee. They do have a Starbucks but the line is ridiculous and the wait time makes you question if you'll make your flight.",4
Airport,"Very well connected, usually clean. They just moved rideshare to a location that‚Äôs quite a bit farther than before. TSA lines can get really long.",4
Airport,Nice quiet experience. Plenty time me to rest between flights. Only bad this was too early in the morning. Restaurants were close.,4
Airport,Finally a quick tsa check point and on time departure,4
Airport,"Not a bad little International airport. The wife and I typically fly in and out of this airport. The only issue I have are the bathrooms not being that clean but other than that. It is a good airport. If you can do it, try to get the schedule for arrivals in the morning on a weekend or midday on a weekday. Then you will be faced with less traffic.",4
Airport,"had a pretty decent flight, but the weather is horrible. wet and cold is not my thang. I am truly a Miami dade resident.",4
Airport,Lot's of good food if you have a long layover.,4
Airport,"Great experience,  bathrooms could be better supplied, but over all Delta is the way to go",4
Airport,"If you can, at least once walk to or from your flight to check out the art installation in the walkways. The rainforest from A to B terminal is great",4
Airport,"Small airport easy to get around.  Basically clean.  I encountered a gentleman informing everyone he was the airport clean up man. Indicating he was there to keep all areas clean.. He was full of energy and was pleased to keep his area clean. I truly appreciated his work ethics
Although my stay was freezing cold Feb 2-4.",4
Airport,"Caught a connecting flight at ATL. The layover at ATL was sufficient (90 minutes) to take a leisurely walk through the airport. There are many shops and opportunities to get something to read and eat. The plane train from concourse to concourse is a great way to quickly get to the different concourses.
I would not want less than a 30 minute layover at ATL between flights.",4
Airport,"Great access. Much better than the Domestic Terminal of Hartsfield Airport. No cell phone temp parking lot on this side, though.",4
Airport,"TSA lines are long, be ready for delay if your ID is not up to date. Flight were pleasant,",4
Airport,"Huge Airport with plenty of bathrooms, nursing stations, charging stations, and food! There is also a shuttle inside the airport to take you to each terminal. Arrive for your flight early to take the shuttle and to also look around at some of the art.",4
Airport,Traffic is hectic unloading but checking in to flights were smooth and the agents are very helpful.,4
Airport,"Large spread out airport, but doable.",4

Airport,"Mostly connect here, but sometimes have flown in/out.  It's a huge airport with tons of traffic and people.  But the airport is very efficiently laid out and it is easy to follow signs to where you need to go.",4
Airport,Very quiet for a Sunday. I don't think I've ever seen it this less busy. I was pleased because I didn't stand in line too much. The best thing you can do to avoid all the crowds it take to get as early flight as possible. The only way to travel,4
Airport,"Really excellent layout. Great Airport. Just to qualms: who picks the paper in the toilet? It's so thin she'll end up using much more anyways. I don't understand why you would order something you wouldn't use at your house. Also, why is there no pre-check or CLEAR on the international side?",4
Airport,"So picking up is a nightmare. The security flashes their light on you to move, but You need to park to pick up your family.  Departure and pick up needs to be seperated",4
Airport,No Highs. No Lows. They got me to my destination safely. My bags weren't lost. Good Deal!!,4
Airport,Easy to navigate just leave enough time getting to the gate by train,4
Airport,It's one of the most congested airports ever. I have literally been there too many times to count. There are plenty of eateries & plenty of places to sit. My only advice...Get there 2-3 hrs before your flight. Between baggage check & having to take the train to your terminal...YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOURSELF TIME!!!,4
Airport,"HUGE. Massive airport, spread over several square miles, making a connection at a different gate than you arrived can be intense, be prepared for some light cardio work to make your flight. Plane trains comes on a regular schedule so that's good. Plenty of food options, lounges and so on. But it's HUGE.",4
Airport,It  was clean and the workers are nice..... I haven't flown since COVID-19...  I HATE THEY TOOK ALL THE SMOKING AREAS OUT!!!,4
Airport,"Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport  will increase energy efficiency through transitioning to all-electric building systems, adding energy retrofits and using proactive maintenance. #energy #energyefficiency #aviation Environment+Energy Leader 

",4
Airport,"Easy to navigate, clean restrooms and helpful staff.  The only negative is that so many of the restaurants and shops are closed or limited on hours due to lack of staff. Not the fault of the airport, but it can be a little challenging to get food sometimes because of long lines.",4
Airport,Nice airport. The Delta gate attendants could have been a bit more pleasant and professional. They were always leaning on the counters and not being friendly to any passengers.,4
Airport,Nice airport way too big reminds me of Denver International,4
Airport,Sometimes convenient to catch a flight from here. Might hit some fogg and traffic on i5 by downtown or close to the airport. Somewhat pricey food options. But we liked terminal B. aka the new terminal.,4
Airport,Went from terminal A to terminal  B. Nice,4

Airport,"Huge airport, relatively clean, like the train on the bottom level that can get you between  terminals in a hurry",4
Airport,"Clean and not too crowded, took me 30 to pass through TSA. Do the online check in, if you are a tech savvy person. 5:44 in the morning, some of the food kiosk are open. Terminal E doesn't have the best ones. Terminal B is the winner. Please bring a mask, be on the safe side.",4
Airport,"Some concourses have better food, drink and shopping options than others, but most are quality. Clean and well maintained airport.",4

Parking is expensive on site ($17/day), but lots of commuter parking options closeby.",4
Airport,"Yes, it's crowded, yes the security bottle neck sucks, however the staff that works at this place ties VERY hard to make your time there is as easy as possible.  Keep on improving.",4
Airport,Great way to move people just not enough seating in gate areas,4
Airport,"Huge, delta hub. Needs more signage for where things are, i.e maps.  Google itself needs to mark places by terminal.",4
Airport,"The airport was fine! Pretty much just your normal airport! The part we were in was cashless at all the stores!, which I found quite interesting to say the least! It is a huge airport for sure! (One of the biggest I believe!?)",4
Airport,"Clean and lots of space to spread out. If you have time to kill at a B gate, I recommend hanging out in the food court area and playing cards.",4
Airport,The food at TGIF will always be what it is‚Ä¶BUT THIS STAFF is on point !!!! Keep it up team,4
Airport,Up dreading the thought of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on Monday it‚Äôs a work out with all that walkingüòÆ‚Äçüí® but I‚Äôm enjoying my Georgia familyüíô,4

Airport,Able to get through security quickly.,4
Airport,Always busy be sure to to arrive early to make sure you find your gate   Good  eateries,4
Airport,I had to give it a four-star rating because so much stuff is closed right now. It is actually a great little airport and I like how easy it is to get through it. one big plus is that because of the whole Corona virus thing there are almost no government officials flying in and out so that's a plus... Still a is that I didn't see any useless elected officials,4
Airport,"40 mins from parking lot to my departure gate at A29. Very efficient, Lines were always moving forward..and this on Easter Sunday.  So yehey!!",4
Airport,"The Atlanta  arrival

After arrival I spent some time enjoying our Boeing 757 before it got towed away to the hangar. 

ATL is actually quite an easy airport to navigate trough given its size so finding the way to the domestic terminal South was a no brainer.",4
Airport,Ceiling at Atlanta airport. Random post but i dont know i liked it,4
Airport,Nice and clean the flight was bumpy tho,4
Airport,"THE Delta flight museum:

Before continuing onwards I quickly dropped by the Delta flight museum off-airport in Atlanta. Worth the visit!",4
Airport,The rental car area is logical. One tram services all car rental agencies. It is easier than shuttles going to several off airport locations.,4

Airport,"Great experience,  however extremely rude and ugly acting TSA employees as a while",4

Airport,Clean and efficient at the world's busiest airport!!,4
Airport,Great airport IF you don't have a short layover. ¬†Lots of dining and shopping options but it can be a bear to navigate on a short time line. ¬†Delta lounge has great amenities but is very crowded and feels a little claustrophobic suring COVID times.Really sad Cafe Intermezzo didn't make it through the pandemic but Cat Cora is a nice addition to the lineup.,4
Airport,"(CONNECTING/DOMESTIC TERMINAL) - The Plane Train is amazing at helping you make connections between concourses. Outlets available between each seat at some of the gates. Very clearly posted signage and directions.

Being for a long time previously the busiest airport in the world, place is obviously extremely packed - but somehow still does not feel cramped. Very nice!",4

Airport,Busy as usual.  Word of advise if you have a evening flight coming in...make sure you have ate before getting there. Alot of the places will be closed,4
Airport,"Arriving in Atlanta was such a breeze. Trams shuttled us to our baggage claim in no time. Walking distance to Uber/Lyft pickup. Traffic was moving steady. Departing from Atlanta was a little more difficult.. everyone was moving slow, no care in the world with guidance through security. Thankfully I've been through enough airports to know the routine, but this location was very unorganized.",4

Airport,How was it? Big. We returned the car and started the walk. It all went smoothly. My only complaint is its hard to find good food there.,4
Airport,Easy walk to terminals. If waiting for the bus give yourself plenty of time  buses don't come around too often.,4

Airport,"Always the best better come early airport,flight and car rental,good snacks inside also,pricey but on time,helpful staff from busses to working and very secure +on site Covid testing hour vary check for times",4
Airport,What can be said it's an airport. At least the TSA line went quickly which was a nice change for this airport. The airport is suffering from what other businesses are suffering from. Lack of a staffed workforce.,4
Airport,Don't take this place for granted.... the air conditioning the streamlining the organization because that airport from Jamaica was rough. We have a great airport appreciate it.... except for beating the hell outta my new luggage. Scratched it to hell.,4
Airport,Not bad but not very accommodating. All the restaurants were closed and shops with thousands of people trying to buy stuff. No smoking area anywhere. Lots of beautiful women tho.

Airport,"Very large airport be prepared to walk, very clean bathrooms was a plus. Thumbs up!",4
Airport,"Easy check-in on a Friday night and not nearly as crowded as I thought it would be. Lack of staffing made it difficult to get food in a timely manner as there was only one cook at each of the three places we tried to eat.

Airport,"For a massive airport, flying International was really easy. It was my first time flying out of Atlanta vs a connecting flight and it was easy. The domestic side looked like a nightmare.",4
Airport,"Very busy airport, but everything moved well. I appreciated the option to walk between concourses if you didn't want to take a tram. Lots of food options, from sit-down dining to quick grab-and-go options. Plenty of healthy options, too. Lots of charging options. Bathrooms were clean and with very friendly staff.",4
Airport,Getting in and out of SMF was very easy. Lines at TSA were very reasonable for a weekday and the layout for terminal B was also nice and easy to find your gate. I do wish there was some more mainstream food options but otherwise it was good.,4
Airport,Every things flow there are not big lines and there's enought distance and space....no so good for shopping but you can a decent lunch,4
Airport,Very fast and efficient. Due to pandemic stil going on I don't know how populated it was compared to when it's as busiest,4

Airport,"This place isn't fast, so take your time. Arrive early and check out the art between the concourses. This is the walking area to avoid the trains. They also have a detailed history of Atlanta between B and C. You can avoid the crowds, also in summer it is much cooler walking than getting on the train.",4

It took almost an hour",4
Airport,"Pretty good for an airport as long as you get a flight to or from one of the newer, more modern terminals. Roads to and from always seem to be under perpetual construction. Parking can really be a nightmare.",4

At least things are consistent since our last visit.",4
Airport,"Most beautiful, complicated and huge place ever! I hate it and love it at the same time. Any Georgia peach already know the traffic would be the biggest hate.",4

Airport,"Easy to get in and out of the airport. It's a small airport so getting through the security check was pretty quick and efficient.

Airport,"As always very busy place. I must say i like the new international terminal more than old one, way more space for all travelers. It's a must for a busy airport like Atlanta.",4
Airport,"Clean, easy to navigate, Wi-Fi is easy to use and fast.  Would love to see more options for f&b once you leave security near the baggage area",4
Airport,Busy but efficient airport. TSA lines seem to go by quickly. I happen to travel frequently and forgot my passport and DL TSA was able to gather the necessary information to proceed and allow access to travel. I was very thrilled with the response and support. ATL hospitality indeed!,4
Airport,So many people and yet everyone seems to move along seamlessly.,4
Airport,"Huge airport, modern, plenty of food options. Pay attention to what terminal your connection is in - the vastness of this airport is both a perk and a detriment when you have a quick connection",4
Airport,The airport was great. But MARTA closed early and I had to Uber to Doraville train station to fetch my car - $85 plus tip!!,4
Airport,"A nice little airport. I never find the lines to be too bad, and the staff is friendly. I get from my car in the garage to my gate in about 30 minutes normally, which is way better than a lot of airports!",4
Airport,Spacious. Clean restrooms. Need to expand food options in International area.,4
Airport,"It's an extremely informative airport, easy to navigate, and plenty of eateries.  The food is a little pricey but hey, it's an airport, what do you expect.  I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't go through security (connection flight).  I've always liked Hartsfield.",4
Airport,"Terminal B is roomy and efficient. Only complaint is Starbucks line, always great when Peet's is open on the opposite end but they seem to have more limited hours.",4
Airport,Great place. Not enough restraints at certain gates in C concourse tho and restaurants closed way to early in the afternoon.,4
Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson back in full effect. Crazy long line at security first thing in the morning. But they kept things moving,4
Airport,The afternoon commute wasn‚Äôt to bad‚Ä¶always fun having parallel approaches.,4
Airport,It was aight. There's a few bars and places to wet your beak. The airport is massive make sure to give yourself enough time to get between gates and terminals.,4
Airport,They have shuttles and skytrains,4
Airport,"Restrooms were ok.
Airport staff was friendly and helpful.
However, few shops and restaurants were open throughout the early evening even though there were lots of travelers on very late flights.",4
Airport,"Clean, seemed to be well organized.  Some airline counter people could have a sunny attitude!!üòÅ",4
Airport,"Whoa. Is this early 2000's Tampa airport transported to Sacramento?! Clean, open, pleasant. No bad things to say about it. Good signage. Easy in and out. I'll have to get some more photos on the way out.",4
Airport,"Airport was good south west airlines was not made me wait till the call for my group which was last
As I wasn't allowed to go first as a military vet",4
Airport,Delta flight was good.  But the line for customs border patrol was crazy.  Longest lines I have seen. But it went pretty quick.,4
Airport,"(Translated by Google) Good service.

(Original)
Buen servicio.",4
Airport,This is alarge airport great for dining and shopping but always very busy.,4
Airport,"Huge airport. Being the delta hub, there was lot of food options near the Delta flight gates. There is a train that runs between International and Domestic Terminal. It is clearly mentioned and easily accessible. Immigration/customs queue wait time ranges between 1.5 hours to 2 hours",4
Airport,Much better airport then O'hare!,4
Airport,"Crowded, all in all a good experience!!",4
Airport,"They know how to makes everything work, this airport is crazy busy. Thanks to all of you that keep us traveling;)",4
Airport,"The airport is an amazing place to fly out of! The security lines can get very long if you don‚Äôt get there in time. Other than that, the service is very good and the employees are very nice.",4
Airport,"Pros: Quick and easy parking, usually sees a lower volume of people & plenty of seating around the gates (terminal b is preferable to terminal a)

Cons: Slower at security, handful of stores always closed, limited flights to domestic locations compared to SJC, OAK, etc.

Overall love traveling from here, it‚Äôs a relatively seamless process if you know what you‚Äôre doing.",4
Airport,Its fairly large but not congested. However I do feel like the layout can make it difficult to navigate. There should be wither more personal to help with directing or kiosks that help provide location information!,4
Airport,"Traffic outside was well-planned at 6 am. However, TSA was slower than usual, causing me to miss my flight despite being there 2 hours early.",4
Airport,"The International concourse (concourse F) needs more restaurants.  Other than that, it's roomy for a concourse.  We arrived in Concourse A.  More places to choose to eat but much more busy (at least the time we were there).",4
Airport,Airport staff were chill and helpful. Only issue was Lyft and uber wanting $125+ to go 23 miles,4
Airport,"You know thos could be a nightmare but honestly all the times I have come through its been pretty great. Even with its size signage is good and easy to figure out how to get to my next gate. They have a chick fil a, so really it's pretty perfect. Know that you will pay between 3 and 5 dollars for a bottle of water but the have fountains that are filtered and made to fill water bottles so do that!",4
Airport,It's nice... just big and hectic af... def get here 2hrs early,4
Airport,Nothing special about the place except popeye's restaurant,4
Airport,I recommend curb side attendant and service for those of us that who need wheel chairs - most important - for those of us who travel alone!,4
Airport,"Honestly, I was shocked we just made our flight. The maps on Delta's app were up to date, and we followed the signs, hopped right on the lower level tram and made it from Concourse A to Concourse E in less than ten min, with a little bit of running. Good signs get good ratings from me!",4
Airport,"The usual ATL stuff. Likely delays, crowded, busy hub. Plenty of places to eat, clean bathrooms.",4
Airport,Was a bit confusing...but when I stopped to ask for directions the staff was very helpful.,4
Airport,"Best airport I've seen in America...
Lots of shops, multiple restaurants, and a train facility to go from one terminal to another....",4
Airport,"Airport is clean, people seemed friendly. Everything was closed or closing at 8 pm. That was tough since we needed something to eat and even stores were closed.",4
Airport,Clean but very busy friendly service A+,4
Airport,"Great transportation to town with the metro Marta subway for $3.50. Clean. Good selection of food at reasonable prices. Wifi at a reasonable speed. Places to sit, eat, recharge phones and PC work near the food court.",4
Airport,I liked it here a lot. The tram does get crowded but other than that not a bad airport,4
Airport,"Very big airport but, they keep you well I formed. Thanks",4
Airport,Arrived at 5am on a Thurs.  Trains were running and people movers were moving. Security moved pretty quick and TSA agents were friendly. There wasn't much open as far as food goes.,4
Airport,I had a blown knee the sky caps wheeled me around and got me to my adjoining flight,4
Airport,Do they run the AC here?!  That would be my only complaint!  Walked all of the concourses.  Clean and well kept.  Neat display in the tunnel between A and B - like walking through the woods.  Didn't ride the train as I had time to kill.  Great candy shop in C and cake in A as well as Chicken + Beer for a bite.,4
Airport,"I don‚Äôt know why !! I always got a random  check all the time üòÖüòÖ

Anyway Airport clean",4
Airport,"Busy, madness but I have been to worse. Employees are a bit rude beside this one gentleman at southwest was super helpful and mad jokes! He was helping customers at the self checkin.",4
Airport,An improved airport from the last time I was here. Unlike Dallas where I will never fly to again.,4
Airport,Good parking for a very busy season,4
Airport,"Its HOTTTTTTTT in the entire airport, iexcept the plane train. I have never seen anything like it and I travel frequently with Atlanta being my home airport. Once you walk off that jetbridge you can feel the heat hit your face. With all the walking that people have to do at the airport the air should be blasting!",4
Airport,"The plane train makes everything in this huge airport easily accessible. Hourly parking is convenient. Lots of food options. Friendly staff at the ticket counter, at tsa and at the vendors. Lots of places to charge your devices.",4
Airport,It is always a pleasure when flying through Atlanta.  I love the walkways to the terminals and all the fun things to look at.  Good choices are great although lots of stores and places to eat close super early or didn‚Äôt operate on normal hours.,4
Airport,It's on the way home. Can't get much better.,4
Airport,"Decent airport, 4 stars relative to others and bc of volume. Could be a lot worse.",4
Airport,No where to charge your phone in gate D but everyone was friendly & helpful.,4
Airport,"A big Hub. Be prepared for a lot of people and walk long distances between gates. Most of the food stores are closed at night, so be prepare for minimal selection during overnight flights.",4
Airport,"The airport has changed allot in a year!! Great work to the architects, designers and general contractors! It‚Äôs looking fabulous!!",4
Airport,Nice but busy airport.  Fairly decent choices for food.   Not too bad for an extended layover.  Interesting exhibits scattered about and in the sub terriainian tunnels connecting concourses A to E.  If you take the train you miss it all.,4
Airport,"Good airport, the only problem is that your in Sacramento",4
Airport,Finally it's our choice to wear masks or not. It's nice not having to wear them in airports all day and in the planes. Doing that I've noticed after 8 hrs or more I get headaches. Thank you,4
Airport,What do I know about airports? Nothing. Seemed like a great experience.,4
Airport,It was nice and clean wasn't there long it was pleasant,4
Airport,"First drink shared with the broski, Cried mucho moving out my sis üò≠ but I cherish the time I get to spend with my family. Thank you God for this journey you‚Äôve got me on.",4
Airport,It was good.  Driving to the terminals was a bit confusing but everything else was good.,4
Airport,"Quick check in at Delta, quick through security. A breeze to navigate. 4 starts due to lacking quality dining options",4
Airport,Landed b12..went to gate a19 for next plane...gate moved to b10.  Got to b10.. 5 minutes later the gate moved again to a18.  It was all a hassle but got to each easily and train worked well between terminals.,4
Airport,"(Translated by Google) Thanks

–°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ",4
Airport,It's a good airport but I've been in late at night and everything closes so early so if I'm hungry I'll have to leave go through TSA all again and catch an Uber or something just for food they need somewhere to get food late at night for late flights,4
Airport,A busy airport with different airlines and Delta being the biggest one. Also have different types of eateries located in there.,4
Airport,Must have been a slow day.  No lines anywhere!,4
Airport,"Easy access, good car return process and transportation. Wide open area for gates",4
Airport,Back home now to work on my other business ventures.... Nice airport,4
Airport,"For as large as the terminal complex is its always easy to find what you need.
Bathrooms could use stronger luggage hooks in the stalls. Long overdue for update. Maybe have a look at Salt Lake City Internationals bathrooms.",4
Airport,Missed flight and Delta put me up in the Hilton. The distances between terminal are so large I missed my connecting flight.,4
Airport,Yo!!!  This airport is pretty big!,4
Airport,I work at Hartsfield-Jackson and it's fairly quiet right now. Check back later. Edit 6/12/2022- It looks like things are getting back to the old normal!  Busier than ever.,4
Airport,I think Delta should use more of their other hubs for connections. There are just too many people!,4
Airport,Everything thing was great until it was time to get an Uber.  Traffic going into the arrival area was completely unmanaged and chaotic. It took my Uber driver 45 minutes for what should have been a 10 minute drive.,4
Airport,"Solid airport though quite frighteningly big , excellent train that connects the different terminals, with a lot of food options. Just make sure that you‚Äôre going to the correct terminal that has your luggage (international vs. Domestic), get there early in case there are any lines at TSA",4
Airport,"A good experience at this airport. It would be a five star, but everything closed up early(food preferences). Very clean airport and good people experiences.",4
Airport,"Not to bad of an experience. Plane was delayed with Delta but it was clean, bathrooms were clean, and plenty of seating.",4
Airport,"This is biggest airport I have ever been.
Train service available for the transportation inside.
Too busy try to be there at least 2 hr before",4
Airport,Drove into long term parking searched about 10 minutes found a spot. There was a long line for bag check which I had planned for so I was ok there. The line moved slowly but steady. I am TSA precheck so getting through security was easy. Our gates were crowded with passengers but i found a seat. I had no major issues leaving and coming back to SAT.,4
Airport,Easy access terminals with subway system thus easy access to gates. Food is a little pricey.,4
Airport,arrived 2hr early for my flight and it was a good idea! Airport is always busy. Always give a 2 hr arrival to ensure you aren't late for your flights,4
Airport,Airport great...Don't fly Spirit airline they moneying us to death.  Nothing even a water is free on Board,4
Airport,Way to much walking. Terminals are so far apart. In line at TGI Friday for 45 minutes before we even say down. Then another 30 to get our food.,4
Airport,"Although it‚Äôs always busy, it‚Äôs very efficient!",4
Airport,"Helpful staff, lots of eateries and overall good experience.",4
Airport,Everyone masked and moving tho pretty crowded. Easy peesy,4
Airport,"Very big airport pretty easy to maneuver around.. Some of the people that work there aren't the friendliest in the world.
Pretty good experience.",4
Airport,Nice Airport busy as usual but friendly employees,4
Airport,"Airport operations seem to work pretty good, but in general airport, vendor and airline employees were much less than helpful or concerned about travelers, especially those requiring extra assistance.  Those that finally boarded us were the shining exception to this.",4
Airport,Never too busy also I never had any issues.,4
Airport,Short lines in B.  TSA experience smooth üòâ,4
Airport,"The only way they could improve would be to have more plugs so you can charge your phone. Other than that is it is flawless. Places to eat, shops for emergency things like shaving cream and toothbrush, the bathrooms are clean and security is fast and efficient",4
Airport,"Still small enough to accommodate decent parking and big enough to go places.  After a few departures and arrivals, one can get the lay of the land.",4
Airport,Anything but American Airlines. Have a good day,4
Airport,"Crowded as usual, but traffic and check in moved with ease. Beautiful sunrise",4
Airport,Saturdays are definitely better than Thursdays,4
Airport,The moved the Uber pick-up spot to the North terminal area. Much longer walk.,4
Airport,"Nice little airport. Not crazy busy like SFO or Oakland International. It has a decent selection of restaurants & burger joints. Best of all, it's the only airport I've ever been in that had no line at Starbucks!",4
Airport,Didn't give 5 stars because Clear wasn't open when I was there,4
Airport,"Clean and efficient airport. They have clear and they have tsa precheck. It's not the largest airport but certainly gets the job done. Unfortunately for me, I did not have a direct flight but still it has everything I needed. ¬†Will fly in here again if I am back in SA.",4
Airport,One of kind. Busy all the time. So much movement it can be a bit disorienting. However some great little places to eat while you wait.,4
Airport,"Fairly Clean, bustling Airport with moments of anticipated craziness! Give Yourself a minimum of 45 minutes between connections.",4
Airport,It's an Airport.  For being the largest Airport it needs more gate seating.  200 plus seats on the plane and less than 100 seats at the gate. DIA is a much better Airport.,4
Airport,"Plenty of shopping and cuisine options to choose from, great atmosphere",4
Airport,"Very large and pretty campus , just wish there were more workers walking around to help ! Plenty of food options and restrooms and convenience store items!",4
Airport,"Clean and easy to navigate. The staff were very helpful. However, I was looking for a quick bite to eat before taking off & things seem to have closed fairly early about 7:30p. Prepare yourself accordingly.",4
Airport,Customer service was great..but they need better A/C it's was humid while waiting to board the plane,4
Airport,Overall nice airport however be prepared to get your walk on,4
Airport,"Pretty nice airport. The place is massive. Be sure to get there in good timing in order to catch a flight. Food prices are expensive as with any airport. Less options for coffee / convenience. Still a quality and efficient airport.
- H üåç.",4
Airport,"No shady spots, but easy access. Affordable.",4
Airport,"Bradley is my home area airport and I love that it really feels like it is. Small, but plenty of options for travelling in and out nonstop to my locations whether for business or leisure. Great atmosphere and when people unfamiliar with the airport ask me about it, I always get excited to talk positively about it. My hometown airport!",4
Airport,"They do what they can to maintain safety and cleanliness.. I get that. But it would be nice if you could actually get ahold of someone at the information counter, they never seem to pick up the phone. The airport itself is very clean though, and they've taken a lot of extra steps to keep everyone safe during Covid.",4
Airport,Smaller airport. Noticed that several stores were closed in the morning. Clean and easy to maneuver in the airport.,4
Airport,"Airport is small so not a ton of options in regards to food/shops, but I didn't have an issue finding what I needed. The staff is very friendly too.",4
Airport,"I love BDL. Check-in and TAA are very easy. The only bad part is parking, but the new garages aren't open yet.",4
Airport,"True Score: 3.5 Stars Not BadThis airport serves it's purpose. ¬†Parking is simple, navigation is easy, and you can get better deals on flights from here. It's an airport and it isn't terrible, that's a plus. ¬†Thanks",4
Airport,"Shout out to Delta Air Lines and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport for amazing service. Got to airport at 9:13 and was at our gate by 9:45!  

*Please always leave plenty of time!  We gave ourselves 2 extra hours to be sure. A friend flew out earlier today and it was a lot busier 2 hours earlier.",4
Airport,"Getting busier each time I come thru. Great overall
Good to see business back but many delays",4
Airport,Moved pretty quickly through TSA. A lot of choices for dining and drinking.,4
Airport,Beautiful and quiet here not like my airport back home (ATL) only con I have is their shuttle from the rental center to the airport it‚Äôs very slow I missed my flight waiting on a shuttle over 20 mins,4
Airport,"I have been @ this international airport,on many several occasions. I have no issues.It was a pleasure to do business with them.",4
Airport,Place is huge and very much difficult to navigate if you are there only once or twice. Staff are kind and worthy off your tips.,4
Airport,Busy place...decent restaurants...gatta make due with the airport lol,4
Airport,"Decent airport, lots of stuff between terminals to explore",4
Airport,"This is the busiest airport in the world and I admire how they handle everything. I wish there were after hour restaurants. I have seen better shuttle system in other states, I believe they can improve in these scopes.",4
Airport,Always clean but always busy üòú,4
Airport,"I stayed on the same level from one plane to the next and ate sushi at Umaizushi between planes.  Service and food was good. I,also, met some interesting folks to talk to!",4
Airport,"Nice airport, minimum lines. Do not park in the West Economy Lot. It's not a priority for shuttles.",4
Airport,"Not too crowded n easy to navigate. Food options could be better, but they'll do.",4
Airport,Small and fast airport. You don't have to arrive very early. Fast fast fast. Easy to find the gates,4
Airport,"Back home.. long day , now to work on my other business ventures.... Nice airport",4
Airport,"I like the way the airport is laid out, and the terminal train makes it pretty easy to get from place to place. TSA is quick enough, restaurant compared to some places I've been. Otherwise, it's much like any other airport.",4
Airport,"Lost one star due to the service at the gate, but then I guess that was down to delta rather than the airport. Bag collection quick and painless, as was connecting flight bag drop. Customs, well I've never cleared US customs so quickly and painlessly, ever, anywhere in the states. Really quite an impressive airport set up, I wish they'd take over at Heathrow!",4
Airport,Good signage and easy change between terminals.,4
Airport,Close to home and small enough to get around. Love the size of the airport. Much better than driving to Boston or NY. Never had a bad experience there so that says a lot!,4
Airport,Anytime I go to Florida I fly from here and people are nice,4
Airport,Is nice terminal... good area to parking,4
Airport,Small busy airport but it gets the job done!,4
Airport,"I like to fly out of BDL because it is so convenient. However, why is the airport area under constant construction where nothing ever seems to be completed???  There is junk piled up next to the roadways and the place is a mess. Not a good first impression for folks arriving from elsewhere.",4
Airport,close to home easy drive from Bristol,4
Airport,My one airport that I know that brings me back home,4
Airport,It‚Äôs just a easy airport to navigate. It‚Äôs not big or small.,4
Airport,"Unusually long TSA lines this morning but they had a representative at the end giving people a time estimate. He was spot on. I arrived an hour before my flight thinking it wouldn't be busy but I still made it to my gate before my boarding. Even had time to stop at the restroom! 

Thanks to all the hard working folks keeping our flights safe!",4
Airport,"Nice airport, clean restroooms.",4
Airport,EGHS Choir entertains the holiday travelers Bradley International Airport this morning #holidaytravel #eghs #hschoir,4
Airport,Very big. But convenient if you know your way.,4
Airport,"Im gonna make this easy for all.  Its a very easy Airport to get in and out of.  Very well laid out, people and staff are nice and best of all no traffic and crowds.  I'll  drive the extra miles just because of this.",4
Airport,"Busy airport but easy to get around Pay attention to the signs and announcementsIt's the only airport in Middle GA so it's always always crowdedGive yourself enough time to get to your flight, ground transportation, etc.",4
Airport,"Clean, I like how a lot of the seats have plugs to charge your devices while you‚Äôre waiting in to board . Everything is over priced but so is life at any airport",4
Airport,The signs could have been more helpful to locate tsa precheck line.,4
Airport,"I was only in terminal A, but a lovely little medium size airport. My experience was positive. The security check-in in my experience was minorly haphazard.",4
Airport,"06/21/22: This airport has had some renovations the last time I visited 5-6 years ago and is much brighter and airier than before. The American Airlines customer service/ticketing counter is understaffed, but nice. TSA Precheck was super fast aka we were the only ones in line. Yay!! Not many food options to choose from.",4
Airport,It remains relatively small and easy to access,4
Airport,"Great airport, super busy but always friendly and efficient.",4
Airport,Service for disability assistance was very timely and professional.,4
Airport,Airport and parking great food places closing as you try to walk in. No good,4
Airport,"TSA Precheck is a must-have at this airport. Can't understand why arrival pickup and departure dropoff are same entrance. No traffic managers/cops to be seen. Extremely long lines for Southwest Airlines check-in, but moved quickly. Great food throughout airport.",4
Airport,Love picking up people or flying out of this airport. No hassle getting in or out and easy close parking. There's even a free parking area close by in which to wait if you get there early so you don't have to drive in circles waiting for people to get off their flight. It's nothing like the headaches of flying out of S.F. or Oakland.,4
Airport,"Easy to get around, even when they change your concourse at the last minute... :/ :)",4
Airport,Much more efficient TSA process than it used to have.,4
Airport,"I fly all of the time and this is the only airport I‚Äôve ever gotten lost in, lol. The employees are super nice and helpful though! The skytrain is really fast and imo, this airport has the best food options of any I‚Äôve seen before.",4
Airport,"My experience was pretty good, airport is big so obviously the walk is long,  i was able to exit the airport without any issues",4
Airport,"Easy little airport to navigate and get around, the few staff I spoke to were nice enough. Good variety of food if you're on a long layover and get hungry, but not terribly healthy, as you'd expect. Toilets were clean(ish) when I was there.",4
Airport,Favorite airport to date. Very clean and no long waits in line for food.,4
Airport,"The endless construction is a nuisance, but I am giving 5* simply bc of employee Antoine ü•∞ You wouldn't believe the nightmare of a trip I had that day, and the pain I was in from destination surgery. Antoine showed up for wheelchair assistance and he was the absolute most wonderful man! So happy, friendly, helpful, patient! My guardian angel that day for sure!!!",4
Airport,Was not too bad had to get my bag checked in Orlando wish they would have told me when got my boarding pass that I needed to check it would been a lot easier to check it instead of Bringing it with me thru everything well at least I know now it got to be checked,4
Airport,Even though I may be a bit biased.....it is very busy place but once you get through TSA there is a lot to do see eat....just pack patience and arrive with extra time and you will be fine,4

Airport,A good experience.  Tons of food and shopping to make the time pass quickly,4
Airport,Terrible baggage wait. Other then that 10/10,4
Airport,Although posted directions are somewhat questionable;  it truly is very customer oriented.,4
Airport,Security was so fast. Less than 5 minutes to go through. Baggage was also very fast. It beat us to the carousel on our arrival. Only complaint I had was most of the food options were closed when we were waiting for our outgoing flight and it was 6:30 on Monday evening.,4
Airport,Covid testing site well run. Plenty of parking,4
Airport,"Not to terribly busy today, nice staff, good service getting thru the airport",4
Airport,"Gets a little confusing at night when they close certain escalators and stuff, but for the most part nicely laid out. Definitely non smoking and pricey as airports always are. The moving sidewalks are a plus and help you get where you need to go quickly. There are also trams that are helpful! Lots of great options available for shopping and food!",4
Airport,There are aeroplanes here. Pretty good shopping.,4
Airport,If I have to have a layover this is a pretty good airport. There are some connections that are quite far apart though.,4
Airport,"It‚Äôs not bad. It‚Äôs an airport, easy navigation",4
Airport,It is a small airport but has enough amenities to make being there pleasurable,4
Airport,"MSP is a nice airport with most of the construction completed. Plenty of food options and well laid out. Wait times are tolerable with precheck even at peak times. Delta staff are always nice and helpful. The airport has been rearranged a bit since most of the construction has wrapped. Limo, taxi, uber, etc pick ups are now across the way on baggage check level.",4
Airport,Clean airport with a plethora of dining and retail options to pass the time,4
Airport,"A clean, modern and efficient airport with an expansive selection of retail and food options. Smooth sailing in and out. There is light rail access to the city but trains are unsafe and unusable outside of commuting hours.",4
Airport,"My first flight into this airport.   Seemed nice, but the ride-share signs are woefully inadequate.

2nd time here, and I'm happy to report they have fixed the ride share signage.  It's decent now.",4
Airport,"The weather is bipolar, but the mantle conference I went to was amazing. Thank you I also Joshua Giles for obeying God when he told you to hold this conference here.",4
Airport,"Great airport, but can be overwhelming and confusing if you've never been.",4
Airport,Good service and good worker insid,4
Airport,"There‚Äôs two delta lounges! Be sure to stay in  the one away from most gates, it‚Äôs more quite and less crowded",4
Airport,They did their best to see that we got to our destination.,4
Airport,"Many changes and upgrades in recent years make this airport a pleasant place for departures and arrivals.  Even so, when there are a large number of flights arriving or departing around the same time, the airport can seem very crowded.",4
Airport,Terminal 2 is always appreciated because it is not so overwhelmingly huge & easy to get to departing & boarding area.,4

Airport,Still has som constantly but it has good signage to help navigate. Clean and friendly.,4
Airport,"It's an easy in, easy out airport that feels small but is a hub for Delta.
If people would use the mobile phone lot rather than parking it in front of the exit doors, waiting for their pickup, it would be a solid 5 ‚≠ê",4
Airport,Nice art accents throughout the cavernous space...! First time here and pretty impressed so far üëå,4
Airport,"It had a variety of shops and spots to grab a quick bite or sit down spaces. Restrooms sucked. Dirty af. Other than that, humid. I'm from out west tho so it may differ with y'all",4
Airport,The airport is much larger than I expected . It is full of food choices and a long walk between terminals.,4
Airport,"This has to be the easiest experience I ever had at an airport. Security took all of 5 minutes, and I was at my terminal in under 30 minuets! Lots of restaurants and small bars available, only down side is bottled water is absurdly priced... Make water accessible if you require us to dump it before security...",4
Airport,Found this super cool place to hang out. Security was quick. Not the most updated airport ever but very warm in the cold.,4
Airport,They work hard to reduce travel trauma.,4
Airport,Friendly TSA even at 4am in the morning. Clean bathrooms. I did see a mouse at my gate... Slightly entertaining üòÇ,4
Airport,"Nice airport overall, great restrooms! TSA checkpoints could use some love though, precheck wasn't functioning well on a Sunday. Update - pre-check works on Sunday now! But‚Ä¶no lounges in terminal 2, and no convenient option to get to terminal 1 with enough time to enjoy a lounge, so that‚Äôs no fun",4
Airport,Smooth travels with the new construction and minimal number of travelers. MSP Tram to the Light Rail to the NorthStar to the parking ramp to the car to home. Easiest commute ever.,4
Airport,"A lot of restaurants were closed, even on a Saturday afternoon. It's a nice airport otherwise.",4
Airport,"Nice airport, not too many hoops to jump through.  Once you are past security it was very easy to move around and find terminals.",4

Airport,Huge place fast paced but friendly,4
Airport,"MSP is one of my favorite airports. Everything seems to be organized in a natural way, with lots of people movers, restaurants, and stores spaced along the way. TSA is usually pretty fast.",4
Airport,Big airport. Plenty of restaurants and stores. I flew American and TSA lines went smooth.,4
Airport,The airport was a little busy for a Saturday morning.  Clean bathrooms.  Caribou Coffee,4
Airport,Not the best but not the worst. Pretty good airport. The lost and found is hard to find but everything else was smooth. The staff here has been great from TSA to the airline ticketing agents.,4
Airport,I was the only one here ‚Ä¶. I liked the quiet,4
Airport,"I don‚Äôt have pictures of the place but it is a pretty good airport, I stayed overnight in Terminal 2 and It has very helpful lifesaving vending machines with food and everything you need. Specially the Subway and Go vending machine. I got myself a good meal from that. Not the best airport I‚Äôve been to but it is really good(at least terminal 2)",4
Airport,It's been a while since I've been to the airport to pick someone up. Improved signage for arrivals is a huge plus! üëè.  Not as congested.,4
Airport,"At 0500 TSA using working dogs and went thru TSA check the quickest ever in a large busy airport; from back of line with at least 75-80 people in front of me, got thru in under 15 minutes; wish all airports were this efficient",4
Airport,The airport wasn‚Äôt vey busy. It was an easy pickup.,4
Airport,"This airport is enormous, the restaurants available are a really good though. Arrive with at least 45 minutes to an hour of extra time. You'll appreciate having the extra time when you have to walk a mile and a half to your gate.",4
Airport,"Easy to navigate. Not too crowded, even on the holiday weekend. Good tram system.",4
Airport,A very nice airport with plenty of shops and food choices. I hate flying but this airport makes it less stressful. They always have a lot of workers at the tickets desk waiting to help.,4
Airport,"Very nice airport and Train is fast,  but Long walks to terminal",4
Airport,Always have now extra time because it gets really it's worth it,4
Airport,Very boring but nice and clean hope more resturants open back up,4
Airport,"I have decided to start reviewing my favorite drink at different locations during my travels‚Ä¶ the Shirley Temple!
 
First up is Blackboard Cafe at bradleyinternationalairport! 

This is the third best Shirley Temple I‚Äôve ever had. I rate this Shirley a 9. It had a ton of bubbles, but‚Ä¶ not enough cherries! üçí 

Stay tuned for more reviews!",4
Airport,"A standard, sprawling airport. No complaints, but no big positives either. Efficient",4
Airport,Busy airport but very friendly workers.,4

Airport,Still a very good airport and as busy as ever.,4
Airport,"Extremely big airport, please be sure to arrive at least 2 hours before your scheduled flight.",4
Airport,I was surprised how fast we got through the security checkpoint. The airport is kind of small but there are plenty of shops and places to eat. Everything is labeled very well and it was easy to find where I needed to go. This place is clean and pretty modern. It reminds me of the Atlanta airport except nowhere near as busy.,4
Airport,This is one of the cleanest most well laid out airports I've been too domestically. Tons of shopping and places too eat. I can't vouch for lines at security but it looks like they move them quickly. Taxi times are a bit longer eg Denver but it's because the airport is on so much property. I'm a fan of MSP. Wish I flew here more.,4
Airport,"Great airport, got a little confused but many choices for food and beverages! Now that I am flying for work I am glad that this is the airport that I will be flying out of, it is not often that you can find so many friendly folks in an airport! :)",4
Airport,"Pretty good airport. ¬†We flew throught here so we can't speak to the parking and the outside. ¬†However, inside there is a mall area that has shopping for many and coffee choices other than Starbucks. ¬†I had a Caribou Coffee that was amazing. ¬†People were polite and helpful.",4
Airport,"Nice airport with large terminals. The mall and shopping area is huge and expansive. There are also plenty of food options. Unfortunately, in the era of COVID-19, many places are closed. I recommend leveraging the website to see what's open and what's not. It might save some time and walking since many things are pretty far apart. Semi-modern airport that is now gradually aging but clean.",4
Airport,Clean airport. ¬†Really long and spear out. Over half of businesses are closed for Covid. ¬†Best place if you have time is the mall area where 60% of places are open. ¬†When fully functional this would be a well served stop during air travel.,4
Airport,The only airport in the U.S where you'll find the friendliest TSA and airport employees. They are super friendly and don't act like they have the worst job in the world. They make getting through security a less stressful process. There's also great options for food/drinks.,4
Airport,Only place that was open early that has decent stuff. Service was fast and friendly. I got a regular bagel with everything seasoning and jalape√±o Philadelphia cheese. Bagels are my favorite they are the best toasted!!,4
Airport,It's an airport. I was here for a layover for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. I noticed a lot of the restaurants were closed but I did get some coffee from caribou. It's an easy airport to navigate. The restrooms are clean.,4
Airport,"This airport is smaller than I thought it would be! There's not a whole lot going on, and almost everything was closed for my incoming and outgoing flight. However, it was clean and seemed like a great place to fly out of!",4
Airport,I really like this airport because of the design once your in the terminal it's easy to figure out. Plus lots of places to eat n drink and prices look reasonable. I'm here on a Tuesday and a lot of places in the food court are closed because of limited help but there's enough open I'm satisfied. Clean restroom a dog relief area and severe weather shelter,4
Airport,One of the better airports in the US. Could use some better highway signage to get there but in this economy it's harder to find state workers who can make signs and spell too. ¬†Nice concourse for shopping if you arrive waaayyyy early for a flight. ¬†Decent selection of food hangouts too.,4
Airport,I've flown in and out of here a few times. No real issues. Everything is marked well and easy to find gates. However it would be nice to see some restaurants stay open later for travelers that come in after 9pm. I did find a kiosk but they were closing up and the self serve was not playing well with others,4
Airport,"Nice looking airport with modern feel. Time yourself accordingly as their might be a lot of walking to get to your terminal, especially when connecting.",4
Airport,"When you change planes here, they tell you -- this is a very large airport!That is true.But I could get from D to G gates without any trouble even though it's far away.",4
Airport,"An impressive airport with many recognizable stores for clothing, luggage, restaurants and concession stores.The airport had more terminals than I expected and I got quite a little work out from Gate F to Gate D and needed it.I score this airport 5 out of 5. Bathrooms were very clean and smelled fresh. Clearly, their cleaning staff take pride in their work and it showed.",4
Airport,A must see! Lovely airport... ¬†with a PRINCE STORE... what more need I say!ArtMusicCultureWho knew MN!The Prince store was closed so here's a peek-a-boo,4
Airport,Solid airport! Good hub for Delta. Crowded on a graduation weekend but minimal waits. Clean and well kept. Some of the restrooms were exceptional. Easy to fly in and out of.,4
Airport,"This is a great airport to connect to when traveling to Wisconsin. Lots of great clothing stores, other retail, and restaurants. A lot of the areas for patrons to relax are segmented and very relaxing and out of the way from the hi volumes of traffic that is normal to MSP. ¬†All areas of the airport are extremely clean and monitored to ensure a safe environment.",4
Airport,"First time at the Minneapolis-St Paul Airport and it was a decent size. Friendly staff, large Delta Club with hot and cold foods. Clean restrooms and easy to find gates. I enjoyed my layover!",4
Airport,Nice airport but could be cleaner.,4
Airport,This airport has me spoiled. Every time I travel to a new airport I am expecting the same efficiency and its incomparable. Keep up the good work ATL,4
Airport,"MSP Terminal 1 is usually great for getting through security quickly, but it gets busy between 5:00 am and 8:00 am.",4
Airport,Pretty well organized for an Airport this large. Disappointed the only massage place in my terminal wasn't open that day,4
Airport,Very busy but got thru with no problems very good people working there will be back not because I have to,4
Airport,"It's pretty good. Not nice in terms of smoking areas but it's well staffed and easy enough to navigate. The stores are alright too, but nothing to really catch one's eye. It's nice that there are a lot of USB charging points.",4
Airport,"Smaller airports have their charm, and this one certainly does. It's well laid out, bright, and pleasant. The seats aren't the most modern, and there could be more charging stations, but you can usually find one if you stroll. The rest rooms are very clean. You may not have quite as many dining options, but what they have is fine, including several grab-and-go places.",4
Airport,One of the most efficient airports to navigate through their terminals.,4
Airport,For being a busy airport it went pretty fast! Second time there in 30 days love it!,4
Airport,"Great airport, busy but they are working on making it easy for all. Construction and business is constant just accept it.",4
Airport,"A small, nice airport with everything you need",4
Airport,"Although we are technically still in a global pandemic things are starting to get some normalcy. The only thing that has not come back is the prices pre-pandemic, and pre-war in Ukraine. Overall very clean.",4
Airport,It‚Äôs this in the bathrooms for me‚Ä¶ it only makes sense. Atl!! For the ladies it‚Äôs a game changer for long lines.,4
Airport,Pretty nice airport i didn't run into much problem.,4
Airport,"Lots of walking, but a really nice airport over all.",4
Airport,Hartsfield is always improving itself. It has decent food options and ample facilities to get you through the airport and to your destination. It's nothing incredible or fancy but definitely gets the job done. Check security waits before you go if you're concerned,4
Airport,Flight delayed. Airport clean and friendly very impressed for a hub,4
Airport,"Nice airport, many food selections friendly helpful staff.",4
Airport,"Love the airport. Currently struggling,  not many places to buy food and drinks, waited 30 minutes at Peets for a coffee. Only one employee working today but she did the best she could. One problem is the signage for A and B terminals is not clearly posted after the initial signs. You have to follow the GREEN or RED colors for each terminal.",4
Airport,Not a bad layover...airport very clean & efficient. üëçüèæ,4
Airport,The airport was very busy‚Ä¶the line for security looked like a Disney line..but it moved very fast. I would recommend getting to the airport an hour and a half early.,4
Airport,Nice and quiet without the rush not as bad to today for international flights,4
Airport,"Honestly, for how busy it is, it‚Äôs a pretty  well kept and efficient airport.",4
Airport,Super clean and soo many staff members willing to assist you with directions or even with a ride(no luck at the lost and found with my missing 300 dollar pair of glasses),4
Airport,"Good airport with a ton of national & international flights. There is a very intricate tram system between terminals, so plan for some travel time between the airlines. There are plenty of motorized walkways and restaurants. Oddly enough, there is only one Starbucks in this entire airport but the line moves fairly quickly.",4
Airport,"While the airport is nice, the restaurants should stay open for the late travelers that have a layover for connecting flights. Of course, this wouldn't be an issue if there were more non-stop flights available.",4
Airport,"Atlanta has always been a busy yet functional airport... Meeting my travel needs for 20 years.

The construction is always present and frustrating at times, but never so much one can't figure it out.",4
Airport,Everyone there was very accommodating to me.,4
Airport,"solid airport, but limited security gates creates long lines. but to their credit the lines moved steadily.",4
Airport,Terminals and gates are nice and spacious and has beautiful new architecture and amenities!! Some important technology is outdated and MAC has no plans to fix,4
Airport,"I felt like that airport is a city within the city I have a big old ‚ù§Ô∏è with Atlanta.  I finally learned how to take the train, to know how to move makes me me feel better moving around.  I honestly felt I‚Äôm a professional traveler now and knowing how to move & feeling very good üëç I w Hartfield airport.",4
Airport,"Not much to say, I landed and it was easy to maneuver to the exit and use the airport service that hailed a taxi for us. You can also pick up your Uber or Lyft here. Make sure you visit the PRINCE store and pick up a souvenir",4
Airport,I love coming home. Recommend tsa precheck to avoid long waits.,4
Airport,For being one of the busiest airports in the world it is easy to get through to our flights.  Plenty of places to eat while you wait.  Bathrooms are always clean.,4
Airport,"Busy but good airport, everything is in good order, nice and clean!",4
Airport,It was a pretty cool airport. From Alabama and never flown in to the airport In Minneapolis. It was a lot of people but nothing compared to the Atlanta airport.,4

Pros: Surprisingly easy to negotiate for its size.
Helpful staff.  Very good rideshare directions. Convenient train shuttle service.
Cons: It's massive, so follow directional signs carefully.",4
Airport,okay place. staff hit or miss. sometimes people around help more then staff. ¬†chaotic or relax depending on time your flight is. usual very fast to go through. ¬†always love this place.,4
Airport,"A couple hour layover. The airport is clean and has clear signage for where you need to go. There's a good assortment of shops and places to eat. As far as airports go, this is a good one.",4
Airport,"It was long getting through the airport but understandably so because it's so huge! There were some food stands out of certain items and the D concourse seemed ... idk... but the hospitality was #1.

Wear good shoes and drink water/ stay hydrated!",4
Airport,"Almost all shops and restaurants were closed in each terminal before 8 pm on a Sunday. Otherwise security was great, along with most of the staff.",4
Airport,"Huge airport. Needs modernising, but easy to navigate.",4
Airport,"Honestly, I have never been more impressed. Longest line I have ever seen at security and they got us through in 30 minutes. The efficiencies they have designed into the process should be celebrated. The employees had a commanding presence with the crowd and we got it done.
Also, everything is very clean and I love the art.",4
Airport,There was no problem I walked off the plane  collected my luggage and walked right out,4
Airport,It‚Äôs the busiest airport in the world for good reason. Lots of people but the staff handled it with patience.,4
Airport,"Parked in economy lot took about 30 min to get to the terminal, need another bus or two. TSA was fast as usual, if you just follow the very basic guidelines that have been in place for 20 years. Overall quick and easy experience",4
Airport,"Busy, but lots of options if you're on a lay over",4
Airport,It's under construction right now but I see that it is going to be phenomenal,4
Airport,"Newly covered drop-off area is nice.  Security wait time was nice and quick, but this was not a holiday weekend.  Very few travelers are wearing masks.  All in all, a hassle-free travel experience.",4
Airport,"My flight was at 8:55 on saturday, we got there about 3 hours early. It didn't take very long to get through TSA. None of the food or coffee places opened until after 7am and the lines were very long when they finally opened. For the most part, not a bad experience.",4
Airport,"Busy and super crowded airport but plenty of restaurants.

At my gate Delta had 3 flights next to each other leaving at the same time. No where to set crazy",4
Airport,Good airport for a short layover. No issues.,4
Airport,"Nice airport, but food options are lacking in Concourse A.",4
Airport,It was good only thing that bothers me sometimes the check through they can be so ugly and with sharp answer not all but some of them if they don't want to work there then go find you another job they don't know how bless they are just to be able to get up and go to work so sad. I came to Atlanta once a year and it always someone like that.,4
Airport,Busy airport but given that it's Atlanta They did well with getting us through with no worries,4
Airport,"It‚Äôs big and bold and does a ton of traffic, but if you get ‚Äústranded‚Äù or have a long layover, it‚Äôs great for walking, shopping, eating and drinking. The PF Changs is great and the Terminal A area by Varasano‚Äôs  pizzeria has a piano player!
VictorB",4
Airport,Extremely busy but all the airport employees who work there seemed helpful and courteous. They gave you great directions and got you where you needed to be. Great signage to direct you. Easy to get around even though it's huge.,4

Airport,Nice clean airport. Checking baggage in was a little slow but it wasn't a problem,4

Airport,"Busy airport, usually get delayed.  Lots of nice shops and restaurants to pick from.  Safe practices in place.",4
Airport,"Fairly efficient, given the size/volume. But they need a better system/infrastructure to transport passengers from the international terminal to the domestic terminal.",4
Airport,An employee at the airport (Rufus) went out of his way to help me when I was looking for something in the terminal. He walked part of the way there and pointed out where to go next. Great employee!,4

Airport,"It's an airport. Not much to say. High price food and drinks, Security that's sometimes fast and sometimes horribly slow  Five star bathrooms",4
Airport,Better than expected. Going out security was embarrassing. No TSA until 2PM. Coming back customs was smooth. Global Entry helps!,4
Airport,Back to normal after the pandemic... It's a good airport...,4
Airport,"Clean and well organized, but has only one bar/Cafe before security check-in",4
Airport,Make sure to give yourself at least an hour lay over for this massive airport. The lower level trams make reaching one side of the airport to other possible.,4

Airport,"TSA efficiency and fast, even take time because there are a lot people",4
Airport,"I actually think this is a great airport.......EXCEPT for the passenger drop off areas. Absolutely chaos there no matter when. But when it's busy, forget it. The trams are fantastic and overall airport amenities are good.",4
Airport,So easy to get around. Nice clean airport.. feels new. Also drop off and pick up.. as long as that's what you are doing it should be fine. People loop around or just park to wait and no one is coming.. but they have traffic control here to make sure people are not taking a spot at curbside waiting and causing traffic. I wish LAX would take notice.,4
Airport,Many restaurants and food stores,4
Airport,It's a solid well laid out airport. Even in inclement weather operations are generally not impacted. I'd love to see a Centurion or Sapphire Reserve lounge added.,4
Airport,"Had a good arrival into ATL.  It wasn't crazily busy, so I got through the airport and picked up a rental car timely.  It was a lot better than usual.",4
Airport,Clean terminal but food was not very good.,4

Airport,"Huge! The washrooms were ordinary. And not that I cared about sanitizing the chairs, but what I saw a cleaner do was poor. Lots of good choices to eat. But may close very early.",4
Airport,The airport size was moderate. Traveling was in ease. I had a connecting flight in just a hour so I couldn't roam around as much. I loved that there was lots of popular foods attraction. The price for food was quite expensive. I got some water from the vending machine at around 3.25$ which is like a lot. But everything else was good.,4
Airport,It‚Äôs a cute airport and realty  easy to navigate around. Though I do prefer the Dulles airport because you can have a whole empty gate seating area to yourself to sleep at.,4
Airport,"We picked up a friend at Terminal 2.  Taking 34th Street exit off 494, drive north. As you travel north , on the right is the Fort Snelling National Cemetery.

Airport,Very easy to navigate now Getting to the rent a car location is a breeze with the tram. Only problem is that they have no cars,4

Airport,Clean and efficient. TSA a little slow.,4
Airport,"Arrived at 830, nice and clean but a ghost town",4

Airport,Airports are never fun but Bradley is a little better with lesser foot traffic than nearby NY airports. Security is picky with what you bring but I suppose it's all for safety.,4
Airport,Busy place this morning. Nice and pleasant TSA staff.,4
Airport,"The TSA line was ridiculously long at 5:00 am this morning.
Other than that, the terminals are very clean and well kept.
People are doing a so so job at masking their noses and mouths. But that's not a overly big concern of mine. Note that the governor just changed the hours of many of the concessions, and imposed a bunch of ridiculous restrictions, AGAIN.",4
Airport,Decent size airport security was easy and finding the gat was a breeze,4
Airport,Right in and through security in half hour. It was good.,4
Airport,"Super easy to navigate. At the time of my flight, it wasn't crowded. Covid practices upheld and it was pretty clean.",4

Airport,"Clean bathrooms, smaller airport.",4
Airport,Great hometown airport that has remained small and easy to navigate.....but don't fool yourself.....morning flights require a 2 hour tsa line.,4
Airport,Quick and fast security check. Small airport. Sad I couldn‚Äôt use my Dunkin‚Äô app to get points,4

Airport,"Clean airport, staff very knowledgeable.  Only drawback was limited morning beverages and Keto food choices.",4
Airport,Not a bad little airport. Gas stations close to the airport. Terminal is old but clean. Security time was reasonable. Rental cars off-site. Shuttle took forever. No Delta Sky Club.,4
Airport,Very busy but people are very nice.,4

Airport,Bradley International Airport is where I went after my prom - Cloud 9 Restaurant! Delicious food and very tasty drinks! I will return!,4

Airport,I am quite pleased with the service I received at Bradley International Airport.,4
Airport,"Very crowded, but everything moved quickly.",4
Airport,I had to pick up my son monday night. The way the airport operates during pickup their is no standing or waiting you're better off arriving after the flight touch down the officers instruct you to circle the airport until the person is actually outside waiting on you which makes sense. The airport is small so it works out.,4
Airport,It was easy breezy from start to finish long lines but moved quickly no delays I really like that airport!,4

Airport,Quick check in/security and clean. Limited restaurants in the am.,4

Kudos to Bradley Airport and many thanks",4
Airport,Best Airport ! Only Covid 19 testing is $125 and dont give nothing to evidence to flight and have problem when you arrive in other airports!,4
Airport,I rather go to this airport than Boston logan Logan might be cheaper at times but parking at Bradley is cheaper better and not so much traffic,4
Airport,Very easy in and out picking someone up.  Signs were well placed.  Had no hassle waiting outside terminal A at door 1.  Can't give more till I have been inside.,4
Airport,"Clean and easy to find a place to sit away from people. Appears a little understaffed leading to plane cleaning issues, and slow baggage, also many of the stores are currently keeping irregular, unpublished hours, and not many options available for late departures. Very efficient layout",4
Airport,"All the benefits you hope for flying from a small airport....easy screening and easy to get around. Needs a good coffee place though. Dunkin is the only (lousy) option for coffee outside of the lounge. Otherwise, one of the better small airports",4
Airport,"The parking it's so big and confuse at the same time, but overall not bad went to drop my friend at jet blue it was so easy getting your boarding pass check bag and straight to the gate",4
Airport,Navigated through check-in and TSA fairly quickly considering how crowded it was. Boarded and took off on time.,4
Airport,"Overall airport is nice especially for its size
Parking is decent, food is decent, and getting my bags was average...
TSA is a hit or miss..... Some of the officers are either nice or just plain rude I mean its obvious which ones hate their life's.....",4

Airport,"Was there only for a few minutes so can't tell too much details, over at all everything was good.",4

Airport,This last trip was my first time flying and i would do it again,4

Airport,"Small regional airport, easy to naci5",4
Airport,Arrived for early departure. Some restaurants closed but ample alternatives were available. Smooth transition from ground to air. We have other choices for our travel but prefer Bradley.,4
Airport,"The exit roads have been changed and are a bit confusing. That's what I loved about our little airport, getting in and out for drop offs and pick ups used to be quick and simple. Still quick but not as simple getting out.",4
Airport,As an older airport you get what you expect. Few charging stations limited eating selections. On the plus side they have the state of art screening at TSA meaning no need to take out laptops and other electronics as they can see everything. Fast pre check and the TSA agents were very friendly.,4
Airport,"Fast and easy to read directions üòé travelled with a big group, was cool to have and feel so welcome by our fellow coworkers.  We all worked together and we all got along..Natasha has been my bestie since day one. ... Don't be a weird roommate üòÜüòÜüòâ",4

Airport,"Easy to get to, construction has made it easier to get around, including picking up and returning rental cars, no more shuttles, very convenient.

Airport,Clean and it was a good experience,4
Airport,Easy airport to navigate inside.,4

Airport,"Nice airport. Clean, not too noisy or crowded.",4
Airport,Small but very efficient airport with shops and food and drinks. Everything was open. Nice place to travel from.,4

Airport,ATL is always a bit better than OK... Not really anyone's fault which is why I give 4 stars... just way too busy.,4
Airport,great small airport.... the people are very nice and it's very clean as well.,4

Airport  was nice !",4
Airport,Check in good. TSA had the longest line we have ever seen. Probably 200 yards long. Worried at first but it suddenly started to move.  About 45 minutes.  Shorter than we thought. TSA workers were very good.,4
Airport,"Great airport servicing the twin cities of St Paul and Minneapolis. I quite like the fact that I can pick up my bag and walk out of the arrival gate to be picked up by my ride. That makes it really cool.

The internet works here too. Great üëç",4
Airport,Nice airport.  Lots of shops and places to eat.  Seems laid out nicely according to the map. I flew Delta and arrived and departed at D gates so I didn't have to explore much other than the length of D gates.  The only negative thing I can say is it appears that there may not be enough seating at the gates to hold all the people that may be getting on the plane.,4

Airport,"I've been here a dozen times and have yet to see it busy. Everything is accessible, signage is easy to understand, shuttle service from daily parking is helpful- only once did I need to walk to the terminal and it took me less than 10 mins. TSA is efficient, the lines move quickly (if any, they're small). I would like to see better food options but thats small stuff- I'm not there to dine:)",4
Airport,Signed up for 14 day trial of clear something.. got to bypass the long TSA line... easy peasy...no delays... the renovations are amazing... mr peetes coffee was great.... ü•Ø üç©  not good.. they need a panera bread or einstein bagels...  you can't fully appreciate Hartsfield until you land somewhere like bwi and have to walk miles to baggage claim,4

Airport,Very big and busy. Plenty of different styles of food,4

Airport,"A big but efficient airport. Sometimes you have to wait a little longer for immigration but in general sufficient and doable.
A lot of shops behind and after entering the stateline.
It‚Äôs big so do your homework in advance.

The shuttle busses to the hotels and rental cars are at the ‚Äòdomestic‚Äô site so take a blue bus or mono rail tram/shuttle (fly train)",4
Airport,"The good ole San Antonio airport - always relatively clean inside terminals and bathrooms, the food court is never 100% open and the TSA check line is over before you know it. Very quick and painless experience compared to other urban airports in the states. You never remember how friendly San Antonio is until you get back.",4
Airport,Other then walking for 16 min to passport check it's all good,4

Airport,"Friendly tsa, Clean and good selections of food and other items",4
Airport,"It's my first time arriving at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Airport. It's a beautiful airport and easy to navigate through.

Airport,"Big, Very busy and alot of shopping and restaurants.",4

Airport,"Many places to eat! Absolutely huge! I had a long layover was able to satisfy all my cravings. The only downfall nowhere accepts cash in the airport, only a select few places do.",4

Airport,Nice airport. Good food vendors.,4
Airport,Pre-check was great. Took longer to get to it than thru it.,4
Airport,1 of the easier airports to navigate. I like that there was a train to take you to the gates. TSA needed to see boarding pass which other airports have never needed that in my experience but no biggie. Only issue is not much seating near the gates and some of the stores near the gate I was at were closed so I had to do a lot of walking with my heavy carry ons to get a snack lmao.,4

It's also very convenient that they don't use tickets so you don't have to keep track of that while you are away.,4
Airport,Not too bad of an experience this time around. The lines were long but that‚Äôs predictable in these circumstances; just make sure to arrive at least two hours before your flight.

Airport,Really...I expect larger bathrooms. Rush hour was a mess! But hey...made my flight so all is well.,4

Airport,"This stop is when I went to the U.S. post office located behind the San Antonio International airport. You get to it by taking Jones Maltsburger and go under US Hwy 281, then take the first right after passing the Embassy Suites Hotel. Drive down that street and follow the signs to the post office. I hope these directions help.",4

Airport,Nice Airport. Plenty of space and not too crowded on a Wednesday midday.,4
Airport,"One of the coolest airports I've been too. But also not top tier clean, very busy, and not the easiest to traverse. The art is great. The marble bathroom I went in was like one of the nicest rooms I've been in period haha",4
Airport,"Very large airport! You will need to give yourself time to get to baggage claim if you have someone waiting. Also be prepared to walk, so have on comfortable shoes. The rideshare location for pickup is also another 5 minute walk. DON'T except rides from the people who claim to drive for Uber and Lyft off the books.",4
Airport,Didn't get to stay long but from what I saw it was nice,4
Airport,"Great terminal, only complaint is the construction, but the building and staff are awesome!",4
Airport,Keep in mind that with air traffic picking up so is the amount of time it takes to get dropped off and picked up. So best advice if your running late or want to get picked up quickly is to simply stay to the left and go down to the ground level to do this. Avoid the right on Departure level,4
Airport,"it's a museum in the airport. If you have time, walk between T and gates A-F  using the lower level don't take the tram. You will see the history of ATL as well as great art. The system of drop off pick up for Arrivals/ Departures is just stupid!",4
Airport,"Get there early!!! So many people at this airport. They have so many flight connections here, so it‚Äôs the busiest airport in the United States (as of 2022).",4

Airport,Easy travels today through airport....clean,4
Airport,it's a extremely nice airport but as expected the security is very long.,4

Airport,Very crowded airport. We were just here for less than an hour for a layover but I thought it was a very nice airport. The bathrooms even had fancy mist air fresheners. They had plenty of places to grab something to eat but all the lines for even the littlest shops were long. This airport seemed cleaner than others.,4
Airport,"Get there early, this is a busy place with 6 or so terminals. The silly TSA has an automated system that isn't to bad. We had the pleasure of getting shuttled to a training group or something and I'd wished the traffic wasn't so bad getting there, I would have felt better with my usual amount of time. It was a bit close but we made it.",4
Airport,"Of course parking is crazy(it took a few minutes to find a parking spot, but not too bad at all), but I must say the travel time was not bad. The young man that assisted my mom was very nice and respectable. This was the 1st time I ever had someone take my mom all the way to the parking deck and my car.",4

Airport,A good airport if you are stuck for a while.,4
Airport,"It's big and busy, but also pretty efficient. You're never usually standing still for too long. The staff may not be cheery all the time, but they are always helpful. The bathrooms are at least fairly nice. Lots of food options. Seating by the gates can fill up. Idk. Just a standard and very busy airport. If you can handle this one you can handle any airport in the US.",4

Airport,"I typically got lost here. I think better direction pointers will be appreciated especially by first time visitors.
The airport art concept was quite unique and held interesting facts about the city of Atlanta.
If you're first timer, trying to get out of the airport, just find your way to the train concourse and get off at the G stop after the T stop. You can thank me laterüòÇ",4
Airport,Mothership never fails. All what you want/need is here. I am so glad that travel is back! Great job by airport management. Additional improvements are required though.,4
Airport,So little caveat .. we used peachy parking which was amazing thanks to our driver.. I forgot his first name but white was his last name.. he made everyone laugh and was extremely entertaining.. BUT the open air parking DOES NOT go to the international airport and we had to transfer to a shuttle which all in all took us them 1 hour to get from the car to the airport..,4
Airport,TSA ‚úÖ lines were very long but the process smooth.,4
Airport,"Flight delayed to get to MN.  20 minutes to get to my next flight and they got me on the plane. I recently had knee surgery and the support staff, that push people in wheelchairs are excellent!",4

Airport,I am handicapped.  The ladies who pushed my wheelchair got me to the gates as Delta kept changing its mind where our plane would arrive. They were quite friendly and pleasant.  Airport was clean. We left on time.,4
Airport,"Big, organized but everything is expensive",4
Airport,"If you have to have a layover anywhere in the US, ATL is among the best.",4
Airport,It is a huge airport. You have to take tram from the terminal to baggages claim. I was glad I needed a wheelchair to transport around the airport. There were 7 wheelchair riders on my flight. I had to wait 20 mins to be taken from flight to baggage claim.,4
Airport,"Easy navigation, even 40 minutes should be enough for a layover unless you‚Äôre disabled/needs assistance.
Plenty of shops where you can buy some Miami t shirts/hoodies last minute. Alcohol is quite expensive though.
Few good places to eat, pretty much everyone speaks Spanish",4

Airport,"Good overall,  signage is not great and confusing when trying to get to different transportation providers or train.",4
Airport,Hartsfield-Jacson Atlanta Airport is one of the busiest airport in USA. There are about 7 concourses with around 15 to 40 concourses in each. There is plenty of place for passengers to relax with so many restaurants.,4
Airport,"Very, very big and busy airport. We had to take the ""plane train"" 3 terminals over. The airport was clean for being as busy as it is. Waited 10 minutes at 5 guys for a burger.  This was after we left  ""Leeann Chin,"" a chinese restaurant, because the cashier was rude and made me feel like I was bothering her.",4
Airport,Nice airport thats very busy airport. It's wise to make time for traffic along with TSA lines.,4
Airport,"This airport is MASSIVE, I was walking around constantly and I don't think I even saw a quarter of the airport!

There are a lot of different exhibits to see inside, and I actually forgot it was an airport because at one point it felt like a museum!

I need to go back again, not for a flight but to just explore.  And to get some pictures because that's what I forgot to do.",4

Airport,The agents at United were helpful when it came to me being checked in for my flight. The agents could have been at the gate a little earlier.,4
Airport,My time here was quick and efficient but another adventure just as well. I had a layover that didn‚Äôt last as long as it was supposed to last. That was fine because we did make the connecting flight.,4
Airport,Flew into SMF for a visit to Napa Valley. A much more pleasant drive to NV instead of from SFO. Was a little confusing which way to go to access bus for car rental - pro tip go left off the escalator. Car rental facility was fast and efficient with easy access to the freeway.,4
Airport,Bathrroms were attended and clean. Busy but manageable. Found the Marta station easily enough.,4
Airport,"It was better than before except that they Stole my deodorant, bodywash and my lotion!!!",4
Airport,"Airport personnel was very helpful. However, air conditioning was extremely warm, especially for the amount of people this huge airport hosts at all times.
This was true for at least 2 of ATL's terminals.",4
Airport,"I've been to a lot of airports, and this one is probably the easiest big airport to travel to/from. The security is so efficient it will spoil you for other airports. The food options aren't great and there's definitely not much selection before lunch. The prices are okay, but you don't come here for the food do you? Overall, there are a few better airports but lots of worse ones.",4

Airport,It's quick and easy if you have Clear and TSA Precheck. I glide through. I fly almost twice a month so it's not too bad. I also have the Amex Platinum Card to get me into the Escape lounge in Terminal B. I can't really complain about this airport. It's a necessity for me to conduct business.,4
Airport,Nice airport. Long corridors. Got my steps in.,4
Airport,"Nice airport, I would love to keep flying through here.",4
Airport,Don't let the size and the busyness scare you. This place is a machine that moves people. TSA agents are a quart low on personality but the rest of the experience makes up for it.,4

Airport,Didn't spent there long but the transportation between concourses was convenient,4
Airport,"I flight through ATL almost weekly for business. ¬†The airport is always clean looking and being sanitized frequently. ¬†A very busy airport, my suggestion is have at least 60 minutes between connecting flights, can be a hike between terminals.",4

AZM,"More fun for ages like 10 to 27. Bed of nails, twister, anti gravity water, lots cool games & interactive items. The "" 3rd"" floor of exhibitions is actually JUST the arcade and mostly iffy games so not worth it. Has pizza area above & below for groups & a gift shop.",4
AZM,"Wonder works
Good for about two hours, some of the exhibits weren‚Äôt working l. Engaging for kids. Look for coupons, we saved $2 per person.",4
AZM,"Worth it!
Several floors/hours of hands-on, etc. entertainment for 6-year old and parents.  Worth the cost of entry.",4
AZM,"Average
It had cool stuff, my kids really loved it. The ropes course and laser tag were the favorites, and the way lunch was handled was great. It was a little smelly but you can‚Äôt help that",4
AZM,"Lots of action
Very staffed rooms with lots of activities inside - the outside looks nice - I side not a lot of space - laser tag and climbing is ok - many experience to explore",4
AZM,"Better than a theme park

AZM,"Had fun
Staff was so helpful. Was crowded but still had fun. I would suggest an outdoor area so guest could have fresh air.",4
AZM,"Family friendly
It is a family friendly place. We have a lot of fun. There are games for adults and young kids too.Tickets‚Äô price is okay.",4
AZM,"It's a fun place but not quite what I was expecting. I thought it was a going to have rooms that would play mind tricks and such, but it's more of a science museum. It was still cool though.",4
AZM,I enjoyed the outside of the building more than the inside of the building.  I'm not much for arcade stuff. I was just expecting something much different than what it was.,4
AZM,Cool place for the kids..It smelled like sweat in majority of the places & cornchips.,4
AZM,"It was ok, not as much as others posts made it seem to be. Good way for children to entertain and learn a few good fun facts.",4
AZM,"Honestly, it was just ok. We weren't too impressed. There were a few fun things, and we enjoyed that but we enjoyed Beyond the Lens way more.",4
AZM,My son said I should give the place 4 stars because he had fun and will visit again.  Good place for kids.,4
AZM,The family enjoyed it. We have two teens and one 6 yr old. The 6 yr old though didn't have a lot to ride even with an adult. Otherwise there is plenty to do. We spent 3 hours.,4
AZM,"Pretty decent for the price, some of the attractions needed to be better maintained.",4
AZM,Have a good time there. I would have slaughtered more time to spend there,4
AZM,"We had a great time here. Granted, it was nearly empty and had the place to ourselves. Not sure it would have been as much fun if it were packed. They‚Äôre currently working with a small staff but everyone was nice. Not something I‚Äôd do again but worth a one time trip.",4
AZM,For single adults.  It‚Äôs not for.  But it is a great place for kids.,4
AZM,Some very neat things. Although kids seemed to be set lose and was running through out the building. Made it not a so fun experience.,4
AZM,STEM activities to keep you engaged for a couple hours. We had a good time but too many things didn't work as they should.,4
AZM,Awesome time. Fiance and I went about a month ago. Just pretty long waits for some of the activities. Other than that it was absolutely fantastic,4

AZM,We paid around $120 for a family of 4. Very crowded but the kids had a blast. There are stairs & elevators for the 3 stories of activities. Lines for the rides & you must be tall enough.,4
AZM,Spend any day or especially a rainy day at this kids and adult place,4
AZM,The first and second floors are a lot of fun. Our kids are pretty little still though so about half of the activities on the third floor weren‚Äôt for us. Still had a fun time though and spent hours here.,4
AZM,Pretty cool place need more time next time. We thought it was another attraction and not this 3 floored adventure! We could have spent all day there! Very fun!,4
AZM,Lots of fun for the kids and adults.   Lots of hand on things for big and little kids.   They were under staff so we had to wait to get on the rides but it was not busy so it was not a long wait.   When you buy the ticket it is for ALL day so you can come and go.  Spent hours in there with the kids,4
AZM,Great place. Alot of  hands on fun with educational information mixed in. Thought we'd stay a few hours and ended up staying all day. The only downfall was food so we left for lunch and went back.,4
AZM,Good for little ones. 15 year old son said it was ok. But overall it was pretty neat.,4
AZM,It was fun but one of those places that you probably only go once. But we did enjoy it.,4
AZM,"We went here when they were offering local appreciation and got a pretty steep discount.

LOTS of stuff to see and do inside with plenty of activities for the kid.

Honestly, we could have spent 5 hours here, but it was so crowded - most likely due to local appreciation.",4
AZM,"This was a ton of fun, but is more for older children. The options for toddlers is pretty limited.",4
AZM,Kids had a blast and really cool inside. Need a ton more hand sanitizing stations. Wait times weren't bad for the rides.,4
AZM,Just go bring your kids adults will turn back into kids in this place,4
AZM,It was cool . It's geared to more older 10yrs & up .alot of cool things & learning bits as well for that age .we had a 5 yr old & 2 yrs definitely not their age groups. But they had fun so that's what it's about.,4
AZM,"Fun hands-on stuff geared towards STEM students. I'm a kid at heart, so this was totally my type of thing. Had a couple issues with the bits working properly, but mostly great.",4
AZM,"Good place if you want spend a long time. Usually few rides were crowded. You can enjoy the different concepts from science, maths and space. Laser tag would so fun if you go with group of people.",4
AZM,"3d movies are so fun!  Several chairs were out of order making the wait time a little longer.  Laser tag, awesome!  My grands really enjoyed it.",4
AZM,Had a very good time. A little pricey but wasn‚Äôt the worst tourist attraction we went too. Concessions was fair priced as well.,4
AZM,"It's one of those hands on museum type places for kids.  Bed of nails and the spinning tunnel at the beginning were the highlights.  You do have to wait in line for everything you want to try to ""experience"".....",4
AZM,Great place for the entire family. Tons of activities. Will go back again. Keep in mind‚Ä¶it is a bit pricey.,4
AZM,Lots of interactive fun and indoor rides. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the arcade games cost extra. It's more fun for kids 10 and under in my opinion.,4
AZM,It was nice and was good relief from the sun. Much better suited to kids.,4
AZM,Our kids enjoyed it but they are pretty young.  I'd say it's better suited for kids 9 and up for the price you pay.  If you want to get a full experience.,4
AZM,It's a great place for the kids. Wouldn't go as an adult.,4
AZM,Our whole family had a blast and stayed for 3+ hours,4
AZM,"I love WonderWorks. It's one big collection of science experiments for you to try in a really fun way. A little disappointed a few of the things weren't working, it would be nice if they had signs on those. Grade school and Jr high kids will spend hours there.",4
AZM,"Fun place! I was disappointed that even with signs advising to use hand sanitizer, all of the hand sanitizer dispensers were empty. As much as it cost to get in, this definitely shouldn't be an issue.",4
AZM,"Kids loved it, worth visiting, better if you get there early",4
AZM,Very interesting building in the outside and lobby area. Past that just has a lot of stuff for the kids to do but overly crowded so we didn't get to fully do everything.My 6 years old had fun regardless.,4
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Nice place.

(Original)
Bonito lugar.",4
AZM,"Fun time, took about 3 hours to go through, lots to do from laser tag to video games, to VR rides, to hands on attractions. Lots of stairs to climb if you don't take the elevator my kids from age 4 through 15 seemed to have fun.",4
AZM,"Took my 3 year old grandson there and we had an absolutely amazing time.  There was definitely more to keep his interest than I could've imagined, just can't wait until he's a little taller so we can have a repeat visit, but enhance it with even more attractions they have!!",4
AZM,Great for Kids not so much for adults. Has a lot of stairs so use the elevators. Cool Building.,4
AZM,"Cool place, price not bad kiddos were super entertained as were we!   A few attractions were broken üòû
more food options would be cool",4
AZM,"Had good experience visiting Wonderworks in Branson.. the rides are good.. Would recommend for half a day activity..

you have to buy tickets again for 3rd floor activities..",4
AZM,Really fun activities but the constant loud music overtop of the sounds from the games and rides is a bit much.,4
AZM,"Wonderful experience with the kids! So many, many things to do, even for our four year old. Really well maintained, especially with as many visitors as they get. It also wasn't overly crowded on a Saturday.",4
AZM,Pretty sweet place to come and bring your kids and family for the day. Only bad thing is they were short staffed and some of the larger exhibits where shut down for lack of staff. Awesome place for interactive exhibits with a lot of learning things.,4
AZM,Good places to spend some time. But I was a little disappointed because I thought I was able to do and see more things there. üòï,4
AZM,Very interesting place.  Lots of interactive activities.  My kids really enjoyed it.  It is pricey though.,4
AZM,"This was not what it's appears to be. Mostly video games. A lot of things were broken. It's very dark in there with flashing lights. I left with a migraine. My kids did not enjoy this. We were expecting actual science, interactive exhibits. This was an arcade.",4
AZM,Was fun for our family but a few things didn't work or were closed. It was way too warm inside in my opinion. Friendly staff.,4
AZM,"Good place to take kiddos. Wish more of the dog had been working, but what was working was fantastic! My 3yo loved the 2nd floor!",4

Good place to go with kids! Lots of things to explore. Roller Coaster area was the favorite. Staff was friendly. Glad we went but wouldn't go back for an another experience.",4
AZM,"Fun
My husband and I took our 2 year old there last week.  Luckily the majority of the interactive things were working, though there were 4 or 5 that weren‚Äôt.  We had a blast.  I didn‚Äôt give it a 5 as it is pretty pricey and should be discounted if the place isn‚Äôt 100% functional.",4

AZM,"Clean, beautiful lights. I just wish there would have been more animals out",4
Museum,"I would've given a score of 5 stars. It's educational and entertaining, but the dinning options after 2 to 3 pm was a let down.",4
AZM,"I wasn't fond of having to pay so much to park, but it was a great afternoon. We had a blast. Way too loud though. I don't think it was necessary to be so loud. I think they could find a way to minimize the noise. My daughter had a headache or we would have stayed longer.",4
Attraction,Kids had so much fun. Definitely will return. Got there when it opened for the best parking. Glad we can bring our own water and snacks. A few rides were down so we missed the full experience,4
Zoo,"The zoo was great, the places for food.. I'd suggest bringing your own lunch",4

Hi, all was good. One thing I would like are more benches in the areas where kids can free build or make Lego cars to race. We spent a lot of time in those areas and it would be great for parents to able to sit and relax while their kids are building away.",4

Huge aquarium, a lot to see there.  No line when I went (maybe it was because of the rain), purchased my ticket and walked in.  It also has a restaurant but oddly enough there wasn't any seafood on the menu (I do not eat meat).  I wasn't crowded so the visit was very pleasant.",4

Airport,"3 hour layover and everything went smooth. Had to go from A concourse to C, and it was very easy. Plenty of shops and food. Charging stations spread all around, at least in the Delta area where I was. No issues. I won't give an airport 5 stars, solely because it's an airport and just being there is annoying.",4

Airport,Airport was decent.   Delta didn‚Äôt open its counters till 349 am and the flight left at 520 am.    TSA was really backed up as everyone was leaving at the same time.   Made my flight with about 15 minutes to spare.   It was stressful because someone needed to  open earlier either TSA or delta.,4
Theme Park,Dollywood at Christmas is GREAT! They were really busy but it was beautiful. I got Hot Chocolate and the special cup to go with it. Reds Diner is great but typically loud and packed. I ate at Ms. Lillians smokehouse. I definitely recommend it.,4
Museum,"Fun & amazing place to take your family. But the wait times for all the attractions were ridiculous. If you can come here when it‚Äôs not busy then you‚Äôre golden & will have a blast. It‚Äôs still fun though, don‚Äôt get me wrong. But the wait times will wear you down.",4
Airport,If you've never been to this airport it takes some getting use to. It's large and has many working parts. There is a tram to take you to baggage claim and another to take you the rental car agencies. Leaving to fly back to your home states will require time at security.  The line is always long no matter the time of day or if you have TSA precheck.,4
Museum,"Was a great place to go. Just would avoid a week day when schools have field trips, made it less enjoyable with kids cutting my family off when trying to view exhibits and interactive things.",4
Theme Park,"I love the atmosphere here; Christmas season is THE BEST!

Yes, they have motorized carts for the disabled but it's still not very friendly to the disabled or anyone that needs help with mobility that doesn't fit into an umbrella stroller.",4

Museum,Awesome exhibits and space artifacts but needs more restrooms throughout building.,4
Aquarium,Kids had fun. Went on Thursdays at 9am. Half the crowds of the weekend. Parking is $17. Pay at the machine before u return to your car. Try to park near the elevator if you don't want to walk a very long way. Buy your tickets online. Children loved the dolphin show.,4

Sports,"I like some of the Chick-fil-a entrees, what do they know about football? I",4

Aquarium,"Make sure to buy tickets in advance, lots ppl and long line ups. Experience were great. Will definitely come again",4

Aquarium,Great aquarium. It was very crowded which made it hard to see things. Food options have been greatly improved from years past.,4

Theme Park,Dollywood at Christmas is beautiful and fun!!! However the purchasing the tasting pass not worth it!!,4

Museum,Did not go inside but loved looking from the outside. Really fascinating building,4

Aquarium,Excellent place to see all kinds of fish! To be the biggest in the United States I was a little disappointed! It was extremely packed with guest and hard to even see up close to the glass. Maybe that's why it felt smaller. Overall enjoyed seeing everything they had to offer with basic ticket!,4
Theme Park,"No parking after noon during the holiday. It was our first time and we for there at noon and they weren't any parking on-site, so we parked in a shopping plaza across the street.

Getting off the plane just follow well.marked signs for ""Baggage Claim "" and get on the tram if needed.  Basically if you see the GIANT red rabbit you are in the right place",4
Museum,"Great for children, but feels a bit too child-friendly and dumbed-down for adults",4
Theme Park,My family have a great time here seeing all the animals and the only downside is that lines were a little longer than expected but it was a great day to be in the park.,4
Airport,"busiest airport in world should update their liquor laws - for instance, why can't you get to goes?  pianist in atrium was cool tho",4
Museum,"One of a kind place to visit,  but it was a little pricy for the after-hours light show during the holidays.",4

Airport,"Good airport, people are very helpful and direct. Great underground subway system to get to your terminal quickly.

-1 star because lack of cleanliness in the gate waiting area and plane seating.

Just nitpicking here but terminals are small and limited access to shops, if you want to explore, you have to hop on the subway to another terminal if you got time to kill.

Overall good airport",4

Garden,It was freezing cold when we were there but the Christmas light display helped with Christmas spirit.,4
Zoo,"The Zoo has gotten much more expensive since I lived here last, 13 years ago. But, it is still exciting for me, and now for my kids!
The Zoo lights were incredible.",4
Zoo,We went the day after it snowed it wasn‚Äôt crowded at all. A lot of the animals weren‚Äôt outside but you are able to see them inside their buildings and warm up some. There are several places to see animals inside if it‚Äôs cold out. Very cool place and will visit again.,4
AZM,U haven‚Äôt been here in about 10 years it‚Äôs actually a really good zoo. Had a good time and nicely laid out I will be back again in the future I was there for the Xmas lights at night and missed a lot of the exhibits and rides that closed early at 4 pm that day.,4
Aquarium,Had a wonderful time. Best time to go is doing the week.  However the aquarium is a bit pricey and the food cost are ridiculously high and overpriced.,4

AZM,"(Translated by Google) Great, just be careful when you go out with children, a lot of mascots that are expensive and pointless (Original)",4
Aquarium,"My husband and I had fun but not if we had paid full price. It was very focused on the kiddie stuff and not so much about the exhibits. I‚Äôm sure parents with children enjoy themselves. The coolest thing was the shark tunnel but having been to SeaWorld, they do it better.",4
Airport,Decent food options. The water is not purified and some of the grossest I've had at all airport. Relatively easy to get around.,4
AZM,Very nice zoo but prices for food is like a theme park.  30 something bucks for a pizza.   8 dollars I think for a smart water.  I guess that is how they get you for giving you a free pass for the year after buying a regular price day pass.,4
AZM,"A really fun place, it‚Äôs an indoor attraction place with plenty of activities for all age groups. Can easily spend a day , 4D thrill ride was fun, during busy hours need to be wait for a while. Rope walking add more fun to it. It has many arcade games as well. Best price",4

Aquarium,Awesome Aquarium but daaaaaaaaang it was very very very crowded.,4

Aquarium,This place is amazing the only downfall is we went over the holiday break and it was sooooo crowded.,4
Theme Park,"Lots to see and do.  Waterpark,  rides,  and zoo. As they say, 3 parks in one. Even a concert venue.  Price is a little high for a one day pass, considering the rides are good, but nothing really big to warrant the cost, but the annual plans are worth every penny.",4
Attraction,"Oh man, what a place for the littles.  Not too big so enough for the little legs to not get too tired.  Stay at the hotel for the extra perks and absolutely pay for the ""skip the line"" pass.",4
Theme Park,"Christmas show was fun, lights show was nice, BUT the wait for the train and the train ride were too cold. Could the management consider temporary heating lamps next time?",4
AZM,"Went to the Cincinnati zoo for the PNC festival of lights, we had a great time seeing all of the displays, but some of the concession stands were out of things like hot cocoa. Overall I would recommend this festival of lights.",4

AZM,No kangaroos üò® how awful! 5 stars if they did have kangaroos. Food was good lots of animals,4

Zoo,Tacoma institution and hopefully be a part of family tradition for a long time,4
AZM,"Pretty cool place! If you haven't been to the Buffalo Museum of Play it's a great time with alot of new experiences to enjoy. If you have been, a lot of the exhibits are the same and imo not as well done.

I'd recommend the Museum of Play more personally, but still a fun time.",4

AZM,"Younger kids will be hard to entertain here, but that's on me. If you have issues with volume, be warned that it's very loud, especially if there aren't as many people around to dull the noise. I would've had a 5 star time under different circumstances or with an older kid.",4

Aquarium,Very nice. A bit overpriced but a nice experience overall,4
Airport,Early in the morning. Everything was closed. Facility was clean and staff was helpful.,4
Museum,Such a cool museum to visit and lots to see. You definitely need a couple hours to see everything. This should be added to your places to visit if it's your first time in Chicago. It comes with the CityPASS but you don't need reservations.,4

Airport,"Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport?Yeah.For now all day this, plenty of renovations to see but I'm sure everyone will benefit from a better HVAC system because BOY it's HOT in HERRRR",4
Museum,"It was pretty fun, we thought it should have been longer, but there were some fun photo moments and props to take advantage of.",4
Airport,"A much smaller airport. ¬†Can't beat the $10 daily parking, shuttle service and if you have TSA PRE check... winning!!! Love that the water fountains are kid friendly height and they keep the restrooms fairly tidy. ¬†Every staff I encountered have been pleasant and a decent variety of food options to hold you off until your flight.",4

Food is expensive and you can't take it in (bag search) so plan accordingly.",4
AZM,It was really hard to see anything besides their lights and alot were not lit up like they were blown some areas were very nice. Alot of walking n have to get there early to see animals or u might see a few sleeping.,4

AZM,"We visited in the off season, still lots of exhibits and less of the crowd. The park is laid out decent and you can take your time at each area to look at the animals that may be out. Some areas closed when we stopped and some animals not out due to the colder temp, still a fun walk and good price.",4
Airport,Security was efficient today. Airport not busy.,4
Aquarium,You can leave to eat and get back in rather than spending 90 bucks for subpar food after waiting an hour in line only to not find tables because people are very greedy. Fish were great. Food and prices suck,4
Attraction,"Had a wonderful time, but the wait for rides was way too long.",4
Airport,"The entire airport was lacking food  for passengers. Otherwise, the airport was very clean.",4
Zoo,"Great for young kids, smaller zoo but had good animals and nice employees. But Woodland Park has more bang for your buck.",4
Aquarium,"Omggggg this is a lovely place for all ages.  It's informative and fun.  You will spend a minimum of two hours here because there is so much to see.  It is the largest, most organized, and interactive aquarium that I've visited in the US. You will not regret your visit.",4
Aquarium,Super busy but interesting and beautiful.  I was told the later you go in the day the less busy it is. Suggest doing that. Remember it's atlanta so take that with the dangers of it.,4

Airport,Was easy to navigate even though it is a large airport.,4
Zoo,This is the Denver zoo. I‚Äôve loved it since I was a little kid and now I‚Äôve gotten to share it with my grandson. There was a little construction going on and most of the animals were inside but it‚Äôs also winter so to be expected.,4
AZM,"Good for one time visit, all wax statues look real & great.. one 4dx show at last is worth watching",4
Museum,"Small museum, It's not worth going to the wax museum alone, you need to go to the other one that has the games for the ticket to be worth it.",4
AZM,"Nuce variety of sea animals, but not the best facilities to change babies etc.",4
AZM,One of the better zoos we have been to. Very clean alot of animals. We went during the winter so could not enjoy the botanical gardens. Animals look like they are very well taken care of.,4
Zoo,At this time the zoo is being rentivated. Most things are closed. Call ahead.,4

Attraction,The restaurants and vendors code before the park!!! Besides that legoland has really come up!,4
Museum,Lots of super fun things for kids of all ages to explore. The only downside is that often there are several activities that are broken and not fixed for months.,4
AZM,U can get better deals in websites. Though on the higher side of the price range it was worth it. Activity will take least 2 hours to finish. Lots of varieties and we‚Äôll maintained aquarium,4
Attraction,"Always a great time
We love legoland! We got an annual pass and it‚Äôs a blast every time we go. They are always working on a new part or having a new event so we never get bored. You can see the wait times from the app which is super helpful. All the staff is very friendly.",4
AZM,"Really super awesome place! Only thing I‚Äôd say is, go on a weekday!! Or not a holiday or day off for kids! Me and my husband went to enjoy his birthday. And it was extremely crowded with all the kids. But still had quite a great time! Not much complaints!",4
Aquarium,I had a good time and may go again when not so crowded!,4
AZM,"The place is awesome. It has a variety of sea life. Good for kids. At the entrance they click a photo of you which they didnot say, its payble. We thought the photo is free. But that was to be paid.",4

I highly recommend you slow down and take a look in ATL. There's a lot to see different food choices throughout the airport. ¬†It's ¬†better to go early because the traffic near the airport is so bad.",4
Aquarium,"It is as nice place to visit with your family and friends. Probably a bit crowded during weekends. Beluga whales and dolphins are great. Overall it is a good experience, plan 3 hours there if you want to get all that experience.",4
Aquarium,"Wonderful visit. Take advantage of the reduce cost for the late admission, after 5:00pm.",4
AZM,"The place is as expected, but the customer sevice for invoicing is very bad, especially the admin who sells through shopee gives very wrong information. Just the date of the peak and off peak price, which is my own work, still gives the wrong answer.",4
Zoo,"Great outdoor spaces , multiple outdoor spaces for children of different ages. Beautiful marine life. It's a 29 acre park as well. Deer hanging out in the parking lot. Very enjoyable place with lots of variety",4
Attraction,"So Much Fun!!
Our family enjoyed every minute of Legoland. It had been over 10 years since our last trip there.It has changed since then but all for the better.The lines went smooth and fast, most we waited was 10 minutes.The lockers were convenient and easy to access.We will definitely be back!!",4
Museum,It was pretty good. Overall 4/5. Some of the machines to get tokens were broke and had a 2 or 3 just take my money and didn't do anything. That's pretty much my only complaint.,4
AZM,"An aquarium not to be missed
Well maintained. Calm and welcoming staffs. Reasonable price. Ocean walker was fantastic with sharks. A go to place when in Bangkok",4

Airport,Big airport. The train certainly makes it quick to move from one terminal to another. Busy place but seems nice.,4
Airport,"Easy airport to navigate because it's on the smaller size, but lots of flight options.Not a lot of choices for food, which is frustrating. ¬†Wish they had an Einstein Bagels or Starbucks in the terminal area. ¬†There is a Dunkin, so as long as there aren't a ton of people departing around the same time you can grab something there.Lots of parking options, open lots or a covered garage.",4
Aquarium,Nice place to spend time in Chicago if you are a tourist.,4
Museum,Still a great family experience. Loved the different exhibits and history. Can be pricey is you don't go on a free day.,4
Aquarium,Worth to visit in Chicago! Easy reachable via Uber/Lyft. Wide range of different animals and exhibitions. Highlight are definitely dolphins and belugas.,4

Grams are open air.  Cold but not raining.  Otherwise fantastic. Exhibit were perfect handicap accessible.  Food expensive.",4
AZM,Everyone was very helpful friendly and knowledgeable except for the lady that ran the lorikeet display. She was nasty!,4
Aquarium,Had a great time. Easy instruction to the parking garage. Payed and reserved online. Walked right into the aquarium.

Aquarium,"I would give it 4.5 starts but they don't have that option.  It's a good time. Sort of pricey but not something you can see everywhere. Good food options.  Plenty to see. In a good area to see other things outside as well. Coca Cola museum, Centennial Park, restaurants.  Worth a visit.",4
Airport,"Easy airport. Terminal A has the burger place near AA gates. Vin Volo is at both terminals, Has a great chocolate snack pair it with champagne. Free waiting lot for somebody picking you up.

Airport,Very busy but functional. Lots of food options but very pricey!,4
Airport,"Its an airport.   No problems, nothing standing out.",4

Airport,Great airport. Easy access to city and to the gates. Faster Security lines as well.,4

AZM,You can easily spend a couple of hours here. Another good place to spend time with kids.,4
Theme Park,So many cool things to do and watch. Too much to list. ‚ÄúChristmas in the Smokies‚Äù had live musicians and was well done. No extra charge for shows. Only problem is I don‚Äôt like the crowded streets and lines. Also a bit pricey.,4
Aquarium,I really like selection of marine life and the teachers were friendly and knowledgeable the parking was great only 10 bucks and plenty of spaces  nice gift shop! And just a warning pretty hot in there dress cool if u get hot like me,4
AZM,It was very nice but I feel the admission fee high for what you get.,4
Zoo,We went for Zoolights. Really wish the adults were more considerate of the kids. Pretty displays and lights.,4
Airport,"Nice airport, can be pretty busy on International Terminal Security check. Also, in order to get to the local train, MARTA, you need to take a shuttle to a domestic terminal, which would seem counterintuitive.",4
Aquarium,"Very cool place! Lots of great staff who you can tell really care about the animals there. There's plenty to do besides just standing back and looking (many touch tank stations).

Aquarium,And I definitely touched a live sturgeon #sheddaquarium #chicago #fish #travel,4
Aquarium,I love Georgia Aquarium and go whenever possible. There's a huge tank that you can sit in front of and it's like watching tv. So relaxing for me. The food options are overpriced and really not worth it. Would rather just bring my own snacks or go someplace else before/after visiting.,4
Aquarium,"Saturdays are busy, but the Behind the Seas Tour got you out of the crowds to see the parts others can't. Very cool tour, worth the money and Jeremiah was a great guide.",4

AZM,Not sure of ticket prices we purchased a package. Great zoo to visit just not very big to me.,4

Very nice aquarium with nice selection of exhibits. Not as big as some in your larger cities but they do a good job of entertaining you.",4

The aquarium is a pleasant, interesting way to spend an hour or so. The main tank is very impressive. We have been here before and it is showing its age a little. It is a particularly good stop while waiting for your boat ride to Ft. Sumpter, that is docked nearby.",4

Takes about 90 minutes.  This aquarium really specializes in regional aquatic life.  The sea turtle rescue exhibit was the best part.  Good for families with kids.  IMO a little overpriced but everything is becoming so.",4

Attraction,Perfect for Kids no older than 8. Rides definitely geared for younger kids. We loved the submarine ride!! All ice cream shops were closed which seemed weird. The BBQ was pretty good! Too much breading on the chicken. The staff were all very nice. Loved all the Lego statues & mini city.,4

Aquarium,Make sure you have tickets or make reservations by 9am if you are on a City Pass. Weekends are busy! Touch exhibits were open!,4
Airport,This by far is one of the busiest airports. The challenge often is getting through lines and crowds. Once you make it to your gate the race is almost over. My only complaint was the restrooms...no paper towels.,4
AZM,Very nice place to spend two hours easily. Kids will love it. Big place with various sea and river creatures. Glass boat is fun to ride. Tickets are expensive 1360 baht/person but worth it.,4
Museum,"Even though it was a weekend and very busy it didn't feel super crowded. Loved how much there was to see and the variety, we could have easily doubled how much time we spent there. Parking was the only complicated aspect of our visit, the lot was VERY full and competitive for a spot.",4
Museum,"We visited on an astronaut day which was bonus.The cafeteria food is slightly expensive but food is great.Beverages are too expensive.I feel the VR ride is also over priced.Even entry ticket is slightly pricey.Great place to learn and visit about space, astronauts, rockets, etc.",4
Aquarium,"Not a big fan of ex-situ conservation, but I have to admit it's worth the visit. Animals live in huge and diverse environments. A must-visit when in Atlanta.",4
Aquarium,"Great displays and set up inside.  The ticket kiosks could be marked better, and parking...be prepared to either walk a bit or pay $$$.",4
AZM,"Beautiful displays, easy to get around. Great place for kids.

A little small and I wish they offered a ticket option without Madam Tussauds.",4

Airport,Very nice. Great foods selection here. Didn't have enough seats at the gate. When are waiting for your flight.,4
Aquarium,"Really fun to visit. We came on a monday and it wasn't super crowded. Seeing some of the larger animals was very neat. I've never seen belugas, whale sharks or  manta rays before.",4
Airport,Be nice if more stores would accept cash. But the main Checkpoint was much easier. Didn't have to take out all of my electronics out of my bag.,4
Aquarium,My family and I went and we had the most amazing time! Also to know that our money goes back into animals makes the high prices worth it in my opion. Thank you Georgia Aquarium for the great experience.  Also the Dolphine show was absolutely beautiful!,4
Airport,"New international terminal, better than most US airports",4
Theme Park,"We have the yearly past. Personally, I think it is way overpriced (also the food inside).
But we do enjoy it.",4
Theme Park,Wonderful theme park for smaller children and kids of any ages who love Legos! They could improve the quality of food and add in some different choices for guests in that department.  My kids enjoy it each time we go.,4

Airport,Nice airport.  Don't walk use the trains !  Good times !!,4
AZM,Had a great visit though many of the machines or displays were not working or needed attention. With the volume of crowds they see it would take a person who does nothing but exhibit check ups to keep up. The employees were over stressed and showing it but still being professional and kind.,4
Museum,It was interesting but surprisingly not the kids friendliest place.  The exhibits weren't very interactive and didn't really seem designed for kids. Overall it was really neat and informative but it was hard to spend much time with any of the exhibits with a bored 6 year old pulling you along.,4
Theme Park,"Overall the place was good, clean, and not too big.  You can do everything in about 8-9 hours. We didn't find most things that are on the website.  I don't recommend it for 2 year olds.",4

Zoo,Great zoo with healthy and happy looking animals but food prices are way too high.,4
Theme Park,I had a good time.  Beware if you go early in the season some of the rides and roller coasters will be closed.  But there will be no lines.  Especially in early February.,4
Attraction,"I love the brand, and I love their products, but they are receiving more people at the park than they can handle. The lines for the rides when we visited were unbearably long. We really enjoyed the Ninjago ride and the triple decker couch ride",4

Zoo,I enjoyed the Denver Zoo. I went in February so some of the animals weren't active. Taking 1 star off because there was a lot of construction and multiple empty exhibits. Would still recommend checking it out if you are in the area.,4
Airport,"This was my first and only time in the Atlanta airport, not a terrible airport but an airport nonetheless. If you have a short layover make sure you get to your gate and stay close to it, this airport is larger. Plenty of choices in terms of food, but sometimes the wait can be long. If you have young kids, carry them.",4
Airport,Smaller international airport that is extremely easy to get in and out of. Pre-Check area had no one on line. Gate areas are fairly spacious and there are a decent amount of dining options.,4
Aquarium,I do love this place and you can learn a lot about the fish in the seas and the rivers but I will say for two people to get in it cost $106 I believe that's too much although I did enjoy my trip I probably would not pay that again,4

I feel like it is kinda pricey though, so if you're from Illinois, definitely save the trip for the winter free days. It was a bit crowded, but not that bad and easily walkable!",4

It was super hot and there was no any shelter from the sun",4

Attraction,"It was really fun - especially the Emmett's Flying Adventure ride. The only problem is that the lines are too long. Almost all of the rides were a 30-45 minute wait. And some of them exceeded over an hour wait. Also, it costs $115 dollars for 1 adult ticket. But other than that, it was really fun.",4
Museum,You need all day to see everything. The computer was down that day .the vending machines were not working too.thanks for the water fountains.we  were parched walking around,4
Theme Park,Love dollywood. Have for years living in this area. A little pricey as always but nevertheless enjoy it!,4
Aquarium,Overall a good experience. Went there with the family. A kid friendly place. Although something they are missing is a nursing station. There really isn't any closed off place other than bathrooms. Other than that it was great,4
Airport,Not bad for both departures and arrivals.,4
Attraction,"Wonderful
Our favorite part of the trip was being able to enjoy everything as a family. Next time for future reference I would really look into fast lane passes because the lines are very long to get on a ride that last 1min or 2.",4
Attraction,"It was so much fun! The kids had a blast with the rides, 4D movies, live shows, hands on interactive stations etc. The only problem is they close way too early and to be honest I wasn't impressed with the food selections (or the prices). But definitely worth the trip.",4
Attraction,"Had a great day, but tickets are too expensive for what it is.... should be half the cost honestly. Wouldn't go back for that reason.",4

But overall, an efficient layout.  Major Delta hub with aircraft of all different types; an av-geek's paradise.  Direct MARTA train service into downtown and Midtown Atlanta, Buckhead and beyond.",4
Airport,"Crazy busy, but efficient and super helpful staff.",4

The aquarium is nice and big, you also get an entry from Madame Tussauds museum which helps swallow the price.",4
Aquarium,The aquarium does a great job at making sure everyone doesn't arrive at the same time and there's a lot to see. At the entrance there are a lot of lights and sounds that I found overwhelming. There were a lot of people inside on a rainy Sunday. I would not go back on a weekend.,4
Theme Park,"Pleasantly surprised with the service, rooms and cleanliness. Not giving 4 because adult entertainment is limited and the hot tub is outside. The place imho needs a bar/lounge area for adults to socialize.",4

Airport,"Like any major airport hub, brace yourself for long waits, potential chaos and crowds of people. For the most part, ¬†the JFK Terminal 4 is primarily a Delta terminal and has a decent range of shops, eateries and seating (can't speak to plug in/outlets or wifi speeds) in this area. It gets the job done, but keep your expectations in check, it is an airport afterall.",4
Airport,"Lots going on here. It's a big terminal in a big airport. Everything was super busy, which is expected. It feels almost like a mall, instead of an airport terminal. It was clean, though, which is good.",4
Airport,Overall terminal 4 was a pretty nice terminal to be stuck in for 2 and 1/2 hours. Plenty of dining options and places to sit where you could plug in your computer and phone. Good for a several mile walk if you're just bored and waiting.,4
Airport,"I forgot how big and busy this airport can get, plenty of shopping and dining options. I was flying back to Tampa from Terminal 4 and it took me about 10 minutes to get through TSA Precheck when that process is normally a minute or so. Hopefully they can come up with a better system to keep TSA Precheck line moving as quickly as the Clear line.",4

Zoo,We love this zoo we had to become members. Wish they didn't have so many exhibits down and construction at the same time.,4
Airport,"Charming little airport
Decent seafood restaurant, but as all airports way too expensive. Friendly gate staff and if you have a TSA pre check, you hardly ever have to wait.",4
Airport,"Flew with Delta to and from my destination. Check-in through TSA was smooth. I know. Smooth. Plenty of food options. Could use some more charging stations, but we don't need those devices anyway. Lots of parking. Yep, that's it. It's an airport.",4

AZM,Show was good pizza is ok service was lacking even if you buy your tickets in advance you still wait in line with everyone buying tickets,4
Aquarium,Amazing set of animals. Very crowded on weekends though. Plan to reserve you spot at the dolphi experience before you get there.,4
Airport,Generally speaking I like it. Get you where you want to go and they have trams to move you from terminal to terminal as it is quite spread out as an airport.,4
Aquarium,"Too crowded, no proper signage, the information is hard to find. Among good things - you can see several species of sharks at once. And the whale sharks are amazing.",4
Aquarium,"My wife and I really enjoyed the aquarium. But I do recommend going on the weekday. Because Saturday was packed, and there was a handful of kids there sneezing and coughing. Resulting in me getting sick.......",4

AZM,(Translated by Google) The little one likes it very much. Definitely took him to Eid (Original) The little one likes it very much. Definitely took him to Eid,4
Airport,Large Airport with significant distances between gates and terminals.,4
Airport,It's an airport what do you expect? Pretty efficient reclaiming my bags when we got stuck in a layover. Very huge. It's fun to walk from the international terminal all the way back to the main terminal you get a good exercise in you can also take the plane train if you're lazy pack in there like sardines,4
Airport,Huge airport! Just pray your connection is in the same terminal.,4
Airport,"Big airport prepared for the cold weather they usually have during winter ,long ago since my last trip,seems they made modifications that make the travel experience better",4
Airport,"Packed, but runs like a well oiled machine!!!!  Plenty of restaurants, and places to relax while passing through, or waiting to pick up!  Love it there!",4
Zoo,"Huge fan, we've been members for 8 years. Would love to give 5 stars but more and more stuff is broken (kids play things) and animals off exhibit",4
Aquarium,Mine and my children's 1st time visit and they loved it! The aquarium is huge I felt it was worth the price also FYI it's different two sides to the aquarium just in case you don't use the map to guide you like I did and almost left out halfway through lol üòâ,4
Zoo,Its nice i like to watch the walrus balzac and the tiger especially the fish cause they look goofy,4
Airport,Love this airport. Small and almost never any lines. Decent food choices and shops. Hope that as they grow they implement the proper infrastructure.,4
Attraction,"It's fun with lots of things to do , but not worth the 100+$ ticket price.",4

Aquarium,"Amazing Aquarium. Whale sharks a must see. Only downside was how busy it was (peak time on a Saturday afternoon). Quite expensive, but worth it at least once.",4
Airport,Hard not give high rating considering the amount of people / traffic going through the airport.  Most of the terminals I've been to has good options for food and drinks and the food and service not so bad.. again considering the volume of people passing through.,4
Airport,"I tried to avoid it as much as I can bc it was messy. However, this time around it was cleaned and organized.",4

Attraction,"Fun place with kids, perfect for ages 5-12 ish. A bit expensive and has no Lego Star wars or Harry Potter.",4
Theme Park,Wild adventures is a fun place to enjoy a day out. It‚Äôs not some huge theme park where you will be waiting in lines all day. They often have fun festivals to attend if rides are not your gig.,4
Airport,"Don't do short layovers here. The airport is huge- you'll probably have to take the train to a different concourse and then find your gate- 50 min was barely enough time, I had to RUN! Other than that our short experience in Georgia was very nice!",4
Aquarium,"Had a wonderful visit at the aquarium. A nit crowded but thats what happens on a Saturday! Plenty of helpful staff. Spent about 2 hours inside before heading to the coke museum.
To beat the crowds Plan to get here early!",4
Aquarium,"Very interesting, full day experience and in for kids! Parking a bit pricey!",4
Attraction,"Amazing! It was a lot of fun, especially with friends. Foods a bit expense. But I guess that's the whole deal! We got there at maybe 10:30, and it was a little busy. But not unbearable. Later in the day it's busy.",4

Sports,The football field was the biggest hit. We also enjoyed the interactive fan section.,4
Aquarium,"4/5 for out of towners given the expense, 5/5 for locals. Reserve in advance as entry is timed and I had to wait 30 minutes (despite it now being that busy). Catch the live shows on the half-hour.",4

Airport,"Less than 45 minutes from I'ntl bag drop, TSA screening and Plane Train to terminal E. Pretty astounding to me.",4
Airport,Bradley is fairly smooth to a lot of airports I go through and I travel a lot. I have TSA precheck so even with long lines it moves fairly fast. Coming and going is smooth and quick. Plus cheap parking with free shuttles very close buy. Shuttles always running.,4
Airport,Staff were helpful.  Lines moved fast.  Plenty of options to pick up items you may have forgot to pack or for the flight.  Well laid out and we'll organized.,4
Aquarium,"Amazing aquarium! There are so many different animals and they seem genuinely happy. It's was so busy on Sunday that I could barely move though. Also everything is so expensive. Parking, pictures, lunch, were each their own cost. But overall it was a great day.",4
Airport,"Very nice airport- probably second best to Portland that I‚Äôve been to so far. Prices are high though, but that‚Äôs expected for an airport.",4
Aquarium,"Largest Aquarium in the US. Admission is $53 per adult! The cafeteria offers mediocre food at high prices. Worth a visit, nevertheless.",4
Theme Park,Excellent place to take your family and pets but be aware that they no longer have a nightly laser show and its during special times of year. Otherwise its fenced off. The parking staff will sell you parking admission and not say one word.,4
AZM,"A lot of machines were down. My card got charged 4 times for a locker. üòÖ overall, fun experience, I‚Äôm glad I went. I got the picture to prove it! ü§ó ‚Ä¶",4
Aquarium,The aquarium was amazing. I could sit and watch the whales and manta rays all day.  Very crowded on the day we went.  There was a cheer competition and a marathon race same day. It was terrible trying to get thru the town.  40 mins to go around the block to get to the garage.,4
Aquarium,"i been their sense i was in my childhood sense i was 7 years old, 13 - 14 years back, and by the way i kinda like it",4
Museum,It‚Äôs definitely worth it but also very expensive. Especially for children a great way of entertainment.,4
Museum,"Discount tickets have to be purchased at the door. The line was slow and long. Prices were so high that it was worth waiting in line. Otherwise, it was an incredible place to visit.",4

Airport,"Although I was at the old terminal, but the seats are fitted with charging outlets. Overall, it's a very decent airport.",4

AZM,It was awesome. Little expensive.but nice. Just couldn't see everything in one day,4
AZM,"(Translated by Google) A bit expensive ticket, but very nice experience (Original)",4
Airport,"Crazy busy. If you're planning any flights out, be sure to be at the airport 3 hours  early.  You don't want to miss your flight.  They have restaurants to fill your tummy.  All kinds of devices to care for phone if needed.  It gets real hectic in the airport, so plan accordingly.",4
Aquarium,I liked those areas where you can poke your head into a concave in the aquarium. The place was not very big though. There were some interactive activity which was nice. There weren't a lot of people when we went on a Wednesday afternoon.,4
Aquarium,"Beautiful, very crowded, and only one small touch pool! If you want to see the dolphin show book it that morning as shows sell out extremely fast!",4
Museum,The museum is good and offers a great cast of celebrities. Each celebrity has a short description and their horoscope. It falls one star short because a few of the celebrities are completely botched but the resemblance is there. Great place for pictures!,4
Museum,"Great museum but can be very crowded
Get there early and go to the Egyptian (main level) and the Dinosaur (upper level) section right away as these areas easily becomes crowded on a free day. You can bring food and water, there are tables and chairs on the ground level.",4
Theme Park,"Don't Go When It Opens
I would like to say, don't go here right when it opens. The rides are good, but don't go right when it opens because there is so many people. I only got to ride 5 rides from when they opened to when they closed because lines were so long.",4
Museum,"Fun way to spend your day
This was a fun way to spend part of our day. Unfortunately we went too late to get a tram tour, but there was still plenty to see and do. Great place for adults and children.",4

In fairness to this place, March is not the best time for seeing gardens. The enclosed buildings were excellent and the outdoor spaces were dormant. I still found this a fun place to walk.",4

AZM,"Love this place but DANG, why make 1 digital copy of a photo 25 bucks.",4
Airport,Fairly smaller in size for such a large city.  Parking gets pretty full but can always find a space.  The parking is ridiculously expensive.  Terminals are easy to find.  Facility is nice and clean and well kept.,4
Museum,It a nice museum...beware it's pricey...hard to say if it matches the experience. I'm curious to hear what you think,4

Garden,"Tulips were beautiful and we chanced upon witnessing a proposal there! She said yes üòâ. Don't miss the overlook loop, that's where the best azalea blooms are!",4
Airport,Great airport crowded Customs but great workers,4
Airport,It's a huge airport. My transition from rental car to the gate was very easy. Delta bag tag flowed. CLEAR made my line standing minimum. TSA lady told me what to do and I did it which made that process easy. I dropped off the car at 6:09 am by 6:43 I was standing in line order my bagels. This time includes me walking very slow.,4
Aquarium,"Good 4 hours. Lots of people today.
Food in the cafeteria is kinda pricey",4
Attraction,Good attractions. The hotel is amazing and convenient. Pricey but worth it. The breakfast buffet is good. The dinner one is average.  If you have children 10 and under? Definitely a good place for them.,4
Theme Park,The hotel staff and entertainers were wonderful! My kids had a great time. The detail & thought put into the hotel were very appreciated too. Only opportunity was the food- greasy and limited selection.,4

Aquarium,One of the best aquariums I have ever been to. Gigantic space with even land creatures. Has a whale shark! One of my favorite animals on Earth. A must visit if you are in Atlanta. Right next to the World of Coca-Cola. Parking can be a little difficult. Expect to walk.,4
Museum,Huge museum.  Best done in one day by itself. Be careful or you may get lost in some of the halls. Definitely going back to see more of it.,4

Museum,"There is a lot to do and see. Make sure to get tram passes first thing as you enter. It was very crowded and loud, perhaps could be chalked up to spring break and weekend.  Lots of kids, strollers, and babies. I would recommend it for all people who love space exploration.",4

Everything else is good and convenient.",4
Airport,"I have to say, for the last 10+ years of being in this airport for layovers and as my final destination, they have stepped up their game on cleanliness and atmosphere. This is now a very enjoyable airport to be in especially for a long layover. Thank you for making this place amazing.",4

Airport,Middle of the night - very quiet.,4

Aquarium,"Small aquarium, but nicely laid out and educational.",4
Attraction,"Pro's:  lots to do;  affordable
Con's:  they need to take a lesson from Disney on how to wrangle large crowds of people in and out.  Lines are slow....ALL of them:  parking, rides, food, etc.   The app said 45 minute wait for a ride.  We were in line 1 hpur and 30 minutes.",4

Theme Park,"Opening day, you have a great past- right ahead of you.",4
AZM,"Lovely and beautiful for kids and adults alike. Many amazing exhibitis and good for 1-2 hours of fun.
Sadly they couple the Sealife tickets with Madame Tussauds which is not worth a visit and such make the tickets more expensive than necessary.

Theme Park,"Super clean, family friendly, even if you don't ride rides it is worth it. My only wish is they had more blue grass. It is super busy like everything in the area and cell phone service in the area is a little lacking. My family loved it so much. My only regret is I didn't take more pictures. üôÇ",4
Museum,"Overall a good experience, especially the interactive labs for kids. My one gripe is some of the free exhibits didn't have much content, and we're only 2 or 3 rooms.",4
Theme Park,"4/5
Some rides were a little late opening but it was the first official day of the season so they get a pass. Great atmosphere, decent food, friendly staff, no woke employees like at Disney parks.",4
AZM,Nice zoo need to fix parking problem and more sitting to eat,4
Museum,"(Translated by Google) Simply exciting....!

(Original)
Sencillamente emocionante....!",4
Airport,"4.5 looks like a school, but has good quality items.",4
Zoo,construction made things confusing but what huge wonderful areas for the animals. my son loved watching the penguin feeding!,4
AZM,"Spent my first full day as a 20 year old at the zoo with my love ugly.bitchface ‚ù§Ô∏è It was so lovely!! We're goin to the aquarium tomorrow with my cousins, so look forward to more creature pics!! :3",4
Museum,Loved the different exhibits here.  The bug exhibit was neat but would have been better if it was interactive with actual bugs on top of the displays.  Still beautiful.,4
Airport,Avoid if there's an alternative which there too often isn't. They do a decent job with the overload of flights using it.,4
Museum,"It was a little pricy and maybe a smidge outdated. But we had a blast! I think it is what you make of it. If you go, I would recommend getting the package and going to the wax museum across the street. The kids had a blast.",4
Zoo,To much construction and can't wait for it to be done. All the animals to see was great,4
Airport,This airport is usually very easy to get in and out of. The place is usually very clean and the food options are ok. Security can get long at certain times and ¬†so you want to be prepared for that. But overall this is by far one of my fav airports,4
Airport,"It's not ideal, yet does not suffer from the massive frustrations of other airports. It's a cool place for home court advantage. The more preferred parking fills up too quickly. In large part because we mostly depart on weekdays.",4
Airport,This airport has everything you will need: - lounges - shopping - places to eat - golf simulators It's a solid delta hub for those that are team delta. It's easy to get to other parts of the airport either through walk ways (most have the auto walks) and they do have a tram for select gates. It's not the best airport but it's not the worst. It gets the job done for connecting flights.,4
AZM,Managed to saw some rare species. But ultimately a small setup (within a luxury shopping complex). You can probably visited all within 30-45 mins.,4
AZM,It is photo lovers to visit .. really is good one ..,4
AZM,It was nice experience that we visited by cable car with my family and friends.,4
AZM,Personally I felt it to be pretty expensive but it's really good.,4
AZM,"Here Fiction made Real, you can meet your Role model here. Very cool place.",4
AZM,Personally I believe this is little expensive for the experience we get to see. There are great wax statues of great people. But there should be more so that we can spend more time over there. Also there should be more lights to capture nice pictures. Overall it's a good experience.,4
Airport,"The airport has vastly improved in the last few years, modernized and made more comfortable. Alas, it still doesn't make the grade for a Starbucks or other update espresso boutique but it has most services one expects. The check-in area of the airport is still woefully small, so crowding is a bit of a drag, especially if you're checking a bag... So arrive early!!",4
Airport,"I love the ladder-like configuration of this airport. It doesn't have the grandeur and beauty of other major airports, but it's very functional.",4
Aquarium,"Great place to visit if you have kids, but beware it's over in a breeze",4
AZM,The place was good but costly for what we pay..... The boat ride wasn't good and the theater was unnecessary,4
Museum,"4/5
Very cool overall but lacking a room that makes me feel very small and fills me with unexplainable melancholy and existential dread",4
AZM,Did the pay for a day come back all year. Will be going back soon!!,4
AZM,"As a zoo, very good. I take away a star because their food service is mediocre. There didn‚Äôt seem to be anything better than cafeteria grade food. Don‚Äôt visit hungry. Better to snack and eat outside the zoo. My favorite part of the day was the fruit bats.",4
Theme Park,"Very very busy
Very nice staff
Very considerate customers
$25/day parking",4
Museum,It's fun for adults and kids. Make sure you book ahead for the team tours and get there on time otherwise you might miss out and there are no refunds.,4
Theme Park,"Had a wonderful experience. Came here from Indiana. Love the entire atmosphere, all theme parks need Dolly inspired music and rides. The only thing that was an issue was that not all of the dining areas were open.",4
Theme Park,"Had a great time. Very crowded, but had a memorable time with my family.",4
Museum,"Good to visit once , too much rush during spring break",4
Museum,"Great place even if you aren't a space fanatic.
Very well organized, with helpful staff.
There is a lot to see, and the tram tours are great.
The price is very reasonable for what you get, and entering was easy with no hussle.
Plenty of parking.",4
Aquarium,"Had a wicked time in Chicago! First stopped at the radical bean, then headed to the aquarium to visit some of my cousins. We then headed to the field museum to look at some bones. Over all pretty cool! üòé",4
Airport,Be prepared for a lot of walking. It is a very large airport complex.,4
Museum,Great place for the whole family. The only thing I didn't like was the all access pass only allow to go in certain attractions 1 time.,4
Museum,Took my nieces and they loved it!! Only thing is a few of the animals we were excited to see weren't out or they were hiding. Also using EBT gets you in at a discounted rate!,4
Aquarium,"Only thing I didn't care for was lack of signs, but was a good place to take are grandchild.",4
Museum,"Space centre section had a good number of things to look at, tram tour was not as good as hoped, if you have the extra of the rocket park then it's better if not I would just stick to the centre itself.",4
Aquarium,"(Translated by Google) Very good place, but very expensive food, excessively expensive (Original) Very good place, but very expensive food, excessively expensive",4
AZM,Couldn't go in because was full of people but from outside we can see is amazing.,4
Aquarium,"We had a great time. The crowded comments in the reviews are legit. Its clean. The staff were friendly and able to answer our questions. We didnt eat there, its a lot of packaged highly processed foods. There are many restaurants nearby.",4
Airport,"This is the busiest airport in the world, but it is extremely proficient in its operations. Everything runs in a seamless fashion. At each step of the way there is coordination and assistance provided to extremely busy and weary travelers.",4

Museum,"This was really nice, you can go your own pace. Kinda freaky how real some look. I wish it were longer.",4
Airport,Sometimes convenient to catch a flight from here. Might hit some heavy fogg and traffic on i5 by close to the airport. Some food options. But we liked terminal B. aka the newer terminal.,4
AZM,(Translated by Google) A good place to be with children. (Original) It is a good place to be with children.,4
Airport,Busy and a bit chaotic . It's clean and most of the attendants were friendly. I just met someone in the baggage claim area. Mid afternoon on Friday.,4
Zoo,Good experience! Looking forward to more after construction.,4
Aquarium,Be a kid. Thats what this place does  Its a time machine to when you were 9..,4
Aquarium,"Aquarium is great! It fits all the ages and phisical abilities
Pictures don't show all the atractivity because of the lighting. You'll like it a lot. They have events during the day and get the schedule when you get in
They don't accept cash",4
AZM,We had a great time. It's clean and there was plenty to see. You can walk through with the Kangaroos. The food wasn't half bad either.,4
Airport,Clean airport but lacking a bit on restroom space and signage for car rental returns can lead you to wrong terminal. Inside signage was good. Moving walkways make it easy to move quickly. Plenty of places to eat as well as having Pepsi products.,4
Aquarium,It was good. Not the best. Coolest part was walking across the shark tank. Atlanta is way better.,4
Theme Park,Really fun but a little expensive. But not the place where you spend more than two days,4
Theme Park,Forget Disney and spend your money here. Family friendly. No indoctrinating children. Super expensive but if it sends a message to similar places ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth it.,4
Attraction,We had an amazing time. My 6 year old loved it. The lines were long and it was raining.  But we will definitely return and do a 2 day visit next time. The park is huge and so much we didn't get to see. Thank you.,4
Attraction,"Lobby front to back was great to visit and pass through before going to the Legoland theme park.

Lego bricks available to build with while in the lobby. Available restroom available too.",4
Attraction,"10/10 place for kids but still decent enough for adults. Pricey, though.",4
Attraction,"My 6 yr old son and I recently went for his spring vacation.  We loved it. Unfortunately rain had moved in and most rides were shut down.  But with all the different shows and activities,  the rain didn't stop the fun.",4
Attraction,Great park for the kids. Food options are not that great. We came in from Disney and Universal so that may play a role in my review.,4
Attraction,"It is so much fun. Bathrooms are easy to find and clean. The small rides have 5 to 10 minute waits, and the big ones are pretty steady at an hour wait. Food is pricey,  especially at the Smokehouse, but it was delicious.",4
Zoo,Nice city zoo with a good collection of animals. Like many zoos some of the exhibits are quite dated while others are quite nice and modern. Easy to walk around.,4
Museum,One of our fav places in Myrtle beach. It‚Äôs perfect for hot or rainy day! Always discover something new,4
Museum,"So many shops, rides, incredible food and drinks. Loved the walk path over the lake. Great parking.",4
Museum,"Enjoyed our visit! Really enjoyed Learning About Sue the T-Rex!!
Walk towards exits when it‚Äôs closing, (don‚Äôt fill up water ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) employees will chase you out and constantly tell you the museum is closed.",4
AZM,manageable size zoo to be able to see in an afternoon.  Not  many animals to see although the most common ones are there.  On very busy vacation times parking is IMPOSIBLE.,4
Museum,Good place to spend a day with family. Informative tram tours. Remember to check-in for both tram tours as soon as you enter. There is usually a long check-in line.,4
Theme Park,"Such a fun amusement park! There are a good amount of rides, fun people, and the rollercoasters are fun, but not too scary for those who are scared or nervous!",4
Theme Park,"So much fun
So fun. Great for the kids and so much to do can't do it in 1 day. Foods a little over priced but no worse then the other parks",4
Attraction,"Great experience. Inflation has definitely caught up with the prices of everything, but theme parks are never cheap!

Wish they were open longer, but other than that, great experience with the kids. USA Miniland cruise is a must!",4
Museum,"Last time we were there was 2012. A lot more going on at NASA, folks. We're going back to the Moon . . . and Mars. Moon 2 Mars festival was worth the trip down.",4
Theme Park,"Expensive but fun :)
Fun time for families wanting to ride roller coasters and other rides. Some lines were frustratingly long. They let you bring in food, which is good, since 1 fried potato costs $9.",4
Theme Park,"It was alright. Less busy than Disney, but Disney is better. Several rides broke down and it's mostly for shopping",4
Aquarium,Little expensive but good family half a day‚Äôs activities,4
Aquarium,"I appreciated how organized the layout was, it was easy to move through. We loved our visit. Parking was a little rough for anyone with mobility issues, but there are options.",4
Aquarium,"Loved this place! So many different exhibits from all over the world. The giant octopus wasn‚Äôt available when we went, which was a huge bummer. Not the place to go if you can‚Äôt handle a lot of people and/or kids.",4
AZM,"Great place for the kids. The stairs are very steep. Use the elevator and save your knees.  Can get busy quickly, and some attractions will have definite wait times.",4
AZM,It's similar to the omniplex ( science museum in Oklahoma City) with different attractions it even has rides a 5D roller coaster simulation. If you get the chance to go you should definitely go. Pay for tickets in advance .,4
Attraction,"Great price, especially for the younger kids. Love the park like areas to allow the kids to run and play. Disappointed that they don‚Äôt have all restaurants and food carts open everyday.",4
Aquarium,Great aquarium but it was so crowded you couldn't do much other than go with the flow of the crowd. The dolphin show was the one time we could sit and enjoy the animals. Overall it's a great aquarium but I'd try to go on a slow day if there ever is one.,4
Airport,"World‚Äôs fastest security checkpoint. Took longer to get through the set up for longer lines than it did actually getting through the bag scan/body scan. No matter where you go, those USB ports tend to be out. Overall, a nice airport.",4
Museum,Very busy during spring break.   Lots to do and over all enjoyed it.  The staff did a great job. It was very crowded.,4
Garden,Beautiful site with many amenities. Four stars given that some things were closed. Some closures due to it being off season however the fishing lake was closed for restoration. Would definitely like to return another time of the year. The kids love the Treetop Adventures!,4
Aquarium,"There is a large variety of aquariums, e.g. hippopotamus, penguins, stingrays, sea turtles.  We can touch different sea animals too, e.g. stingrays, anemones, starfish, bullhead sharks.",4
AZM,Long lines so come early and keep your ticket for re-entry.  I weighed too much to get on the astronaut simulator üòî. ‚Ä¶,4
Theme Park,It was busier  then I remembered. Didn't get to go on a lot of rides. Lines soo long. Still loved it,4
Garden,"I wish it were bigger and not surrounded by loud, busy streets that I hear the whole time",4
Airport,The line for TSA was to long and the went fast.,4
Aquarium,So many cool exhibits and fish however I found it kind of gimmicky and didn't get to see the fish as much as I wanted. Don't go on weekends it's very crowded,4
AZM,Great and relaxing place. It's usually very quiet and I enjoy just walking around to get out in the air and have a quiet place to go. I have an annual season pass for one for $99 and they let you bring a guest in each time for free. I'm not sure if it's gone up since I purchased mine,4
Attraction,"Fun for my 4 year old. Lots of walking with hills for those with bad knees. Definitely need 2 days to explore everything
Lots to do here. Only downfall is the hours. If they were open longer, would give you more time to do more. But it‚Äôs a business that has to make their money.",4
Museum,"Awesome experience, only negative was that cafeteria closed way too early. Many people wanted to buy food",4
AZM,"Got in right when it opened on a week day. Some of the animals, especially the carp, paid extra attention as I was the only person in there.",4
Aquarium,Great place to visit. Order tickets online before you go. It gets busy during the weekend but well worth the wait lines to get in go fast. Plenty of things to see,4
Museum,Cheaper entry fee if you're a resident of Chicago or Illinois.,4
Aquarium,We had a good time. It was a little crowded though.,4
AZM,"If it'd been seventeen years since I've been here and it has gotten much better the price is a bit more expensive than the OTHER place (RBONüêÇüí©)
I vote WONDEREORKs for the win üß≥ ‚Ä¶",4
AZM,"We visited on an extremely busy evening, plenty of fun!!

However I would strongly recommend postponing until another time if you see the sign warning of how busy the attraction is.

If you want to feel like a kid again, this is the place to be!",4
Airport,Second and final of the night is delta 2276 with service from ATL-JAX.  Aircraft tonight is a B757-200(H) and thanks to my upgrade clearing I‚Äôll be in First Class seat 5D for the 1 hour 12 minute ride southeast.,4
Zoo,"It was a little small but for the price it was fun. The animals all looked very health and well cared for and the walking path is paved making it super easy for wheelchairs, wagons, and strollers.",4
AZM,(Translated by Google) A place where you can take your children to play (Original) A place where you can take your children to play (Original),4
Attraction,Perfect theme park for an 8 and 11 year old.....the rides and food were appropriate and good.   The only drawback was that Emmett's ride had ridiculous lines and was broken parts of the days we were there.  Highly recommend staying at the hotel onsite....almost as fun as the park.,4
Airport,One of the largest airports but the most chaotic on the outside but calm on the inside. Stopped by a lot of different stores and the hostess were rude.,4
AZM,"Nice, but small. Lots of cool exhibits. ¬†Loved the jellyfish room and climbing activity. Walked through in about an hour.",4
AZM,"Delightful. ¬†Parking was a hassle but prayed for a spot and bingo....pulled right in near front door. ¬†Thank you lord. ¬†Park was clean, weather was wonderful and staff was friendly. ¬†Great to be back in Florida.",4
Airport,"Traffick can be a bit heavy, but that's expected at an International Airport. Nice ,clean environment.",4
Theme Park,Was a fun but chilly day! We did over hear several groups of people upset that most of the rides where shut down because of the temperature outside. So my advice would be to download the app and see what rides are running before buying your tickets!,4
Airport,"(Translated by Google) 100% service, everything is at hand in less than 20 minutes I was in the waiting room. (Translated by Google) The service at 100% everything is at hand in less than 20 minutes I was in the waiting room.",4
Aquarium,we never got around to taking  pictures on the roof of a parking garage but we did master the art of public transportation and found the best hot dog stand there is and also we found nemo so i‚Äôd consider spring break 2023 a success,4
AZM,Some areas were under reconstruction but we got to see the bulk of it & enjoyed our day there. I appreciated the botanical specimens worked into the surrounds. There could be a few more way finding signs for small branching paths that seclude an exhibit (ex: red panda). Love the solar parking area.,4
Aquarium,good but not the best compare the one in Tokyo and china,4
Aquarium,"The service is good, the animals are tons of fun, and the food is pretty good, but the 4D theatre wasn't enjoyable in the slightest. Still worth the trip though",4
Theme Park,"Great place to have fun with your children, just expect to stand in line.",4
Museum,My family and I had a wonderful time. We loved all the props and how realistic the figures are. My husband and I really enjoyed how spacious everything was. We visited a different wax museum and it was very crowded and cluttered. This museum was very well designed.,4
Airport,"Big airport but easy to navigate. Food court was crowded, but restaurants down aisles had available seating. Clean ,attended restroom",4
Zoo,Great zoo! There's so much to see and do. You'll definitely need the whole day to see it or even two. Coffee and alcoholic drinks are available. And the stroller rentals are easy to deal with.,4
Airport,"This airport is a bit confusing to get in and out of. But if you‚Äôre flying on AA, you don‚Äôt have to take the train out to the terminals, so that‚Äôs an added benefit.",4
Theme Park,Just want to say they do not accept cash anywhere in a park. They have an ATM machine in a big store that you can put your cash in and get a card back.which you can use there! Park is great and exciting for kids 5 to 12.,4
AZM,Very nice aquarium.  It was very expensive.  The ride was very cool.,4
Airport,Wonderful airport. Very busy place.,4
AZM,"We had such a wonderful time at the zoo for my grandson's birthday.
They had bugtopia and all three of my grandsons got a kick out of it.
They also enjoyed the roller coaster, played at the playground for a while and then we ended our day with them playing at the slash pad.",4
Aquarium,Lots of people on the weekends but we still had a good time.  If you are going to go more than two times in one year it makes sense to get the membership.  Will be back when the outdootlr penguin exhibit opens.   Try to get there during the week if you are able to.,4
Aquarium,"Very nice well maintained aquarium with a great skyline view of Philadelphia from the outside.

You can get through it in an hour but lots to see there. They have a ton of things for the kids like an outdoor play area, touch sea creatures, indoor play area and more.",4
Airport,Any airport design that allows me to get from A32 to E15 in 15 minutes on foot and rail at only a brisk walk is a winner!,4
Theme Park,It was so fun as usual. But quite a lot of rides were not open. üòï Then a few of them opened later in the day probably because of cold weather I'm guessing. But overall we were pleased. üòÄ,4
Zoo,"During the week is best. Less foot traffic, and we didn't feel rushed. Loved the big cat and elephant exhibits.",4
Theme Park,"Nice, pretty clean, but needs more pizazz.  Things seem a little run down or sun faded. Grandkids loved it. Better than Disney",4
Aquarium,"Nice aquarium, loved the huge tanks. For the price I felt like we're done way too soon. If you have younger kids I think this would be great. Most important is the work they do rescuing the wildlife.",4
Aquarium,Not to crowded early so we got to see a lot! Kids loved it,4
Aquarium,"I felt it was a little pricey based on their small-ish collection, but they've added the sea turtle rehab since the last time I went so I'm sure that's why. üòä Loved seeing all the fish and the otters of course! Such a relaxing place to visit and watch the fish swim for hours on end.",4
Aquarium,"A wonderful time, not crowded and the fish and exhibits are great",4
Aquarium,"Was nice going here again as it had been a while. We are local and most times when we consider going, it's tourist season and frustrating to go near the area. For us local, this visit was awesome! Less traffic, easy parking and no crowds. Guess the best time to go is during the cold months for us.",4
Aquarium,Excellent family experience! We have a year pass and take our granddaughter once per month. All displays are always new no matter how many times visited.,4
Aquarium,Good experience. Wide variety of animals. Wish the species were labeled better. Had to do a lot of asking.,4
Aquarium,Lovely little aquarium.  Don't miss the sea turtle exhibit.,4
Aquarium,Paid parking in a nearby lot is available. Great interactive aquarium that engages kids! We are visiting from New York and my husband liked this place even more than the New York Aquarium and NJ Sea Life that we've been to. Highly recommend for any family with children and even adults.,4
Aquarium,"Cute place to bring the kids for about an hour or so. It's not very large, but the animals are worth checking out. The kids had a blast!",4
Aquarium,It's a fun place if you are a little kid 4 to 8 years old. For older kids it's very boring and there is not a lot to do there but it has cool fish!üê¨üêüüê†,4
Aquarium,This was a nice past timer to experience while being in Charleston. It's not a huge aquarium but will give you a chance to look at some cool underwater life. The big tank with all of the fish is pretty cool. I enjoyed the ü¶à swimming around in the tank the most.,4
Aquarium,Had fun there with the family. Only spent a couple hours to get through everything. Note that some parts are indoors and some are outdoors. We were able to see some dolphins going by in the water.,4
Aquarium,Nice place. Best part about it was feeding the sting Ray. Was expecting more though. Lot smaller then what I thought it would be,4
Aquarium,Nice selection of fish and displays. Several interactive exhibits targeting children. But it is very small...,4
Aquarium,"Very nice, family friendly, informative and fun for the kids. However, the gift shop prices and snack prices were way too high. Any reply concerning COVID and\or supply chain issues would be a weak and lame excuse.",4
Aquarium,Had a great time with my grandkids. The touch tank is fun. A wonderful way to spend a couple of hours. I do miss the little caf√© they used to have. The snack bar is limited and expensive.,4
Aquarium,$80 plus for a family of 4 for 1 HR to walk through but all and all it was good for the kids,4
Aquarium,"Not as big as I was expecting, but much more interactive and informative than other aquariums I've been to. A little pricey but I think it's worth it.",4
Aquarium,"Kind of pricey for the size but, great place to spend some time when the weather calls for an indoor activity.",4
Aquarium,It's fun for smaller kids with letting sharks and stingrays. Kind of small but if course full of information about marine wildlife as well as local land wildlife. The bald eagle is beautiful!,4
Aquarium,"Great kids section with very engaged staff and a great mission saving the turtles. Its quite expensive, however, and the exhibits are smaller than other state aquariums I've been to. I would anticipate this place to only be engaging for about 1.5 - 2 hours tops for most kids.",4
Aquarium,It was nice and you got to pet some of the animals but it it SO expensive to go! For a child (mine was 3 years old) is $23... but he did enjoy the interactive play area for the kids.,4
Aquarium,"Very very small for the price. Definitely geared towards younger kids. Went with a 3 year old who had a good time. Some cool exhibits, definitely love the little sea turtle hospital.",4
Aquarium,Worth a visit if you are new to the area or have small children,4
Aquarium,"Not as big as some, but a very well designed aquarium. They do a great job showing the diversity of SC from the coast to the Piedmont to the foothills of the upstate",4
Aquarium,"It has the largest tank in North America. Took me and my partner about 1-1.5hrs to walk through. Seems a little expensive, but you can see the turtles that are being rehabilitated.",4
Aquarium,"Had a good time visiting the SC Aquarium. It‚Äôs more of a smaller aquarium compared to others, it‚Äôs a bit pricey too for the animals and fish that they have. Good place to go if you have kids for sure, but nothing to write home about.",4
Aquarium,Nice aquarium with great views and exhibits. Smaller than what I expected but still had an enjoyable visit.,4
Aquarium,"This is a nice aquarium. It‚Äôs a little small and overpriced. $90 for me and my two kids. I would suggest them putting guiding arrows on the floor, as I felt we were kind of wandering aimlessly.",4
Aquarium,Wish they had dolphins. But every animal was awesome.,4
Aquarium,It's smaller than what you would expect but it's super nice. My only issue is that it needs updates. I first visited here 5 years ago and everything is exactly the same as I remember.,4
Aquarium,"A lil pricey, however, it goes to a great cause. The exhibits have changed quite a bit over the years.  There are more interactive things and we were saddened to discover the albino alligator had passed. This was a birthday gift to our son. He was thrilled.",4
Aquarium,Very beautiful aquarium! Super friendly staff. Could use an eatery of sorts attached or nearby. The snack bar was closed.,4
Aquarium,"Excellent main aquarium, worth seeing. Lots of conservation and education. Overall not as large as I would have liked to see.",4
Aquarium,Very cool place to see cool animals.  Very busy and was clean. Staff was nice but can be pricey.  Was warm inside but still had fun.,4
Aquarium,A bit pricey for a family outing but fun on a rainy day in Charleston. Friendly and helpful employees.  Fun exhibits with the touch tank being one of my favorites along with seeing the sharks.,4
Aquarium,This is a small aquarium but has lots to see! We have a membership and our family loves to go together.,4
Aquarium,I think they had some good variety of fish. üê† I didn‚Äôt think it was really big but seemed like it was a fun thing to do on a rainy day.,4
Aquarium,Smaller than Georgia and Chattanooga but so much more interactive.. beautiful space,4
Aquarium,"Although the aquarium is small , but it is engaging and my 3 year old daughter had nice time learning all about sea creatures.",4
Aquarium,Found it to be very interesting they really do a great job with kids . I found it to be pricy for the size of it and the parking wasn‚Äôt the greatest it was still enjoyable,4
Aquarium,Pretty nice place. Little hefty price for the payoff though.,4
Aquarium,"Great Aquarium! I love the Salt Marsh portion.

Didn't see any specific crab exhibits (which are my favorite), but enjoyed everything else!",4
Aquarium,"Excellent aquarium. Follow the suggested path on the map for the best experience. Effortless and small enough to get through, but large enough to keep interest with great exhibits.",4
AZM,"Good experience but i think they need to update the statue and remove some Bollywood hero's statues like, Kareena kapoor Anushka Dhawan Karan Johar.",4
Aquarium,"(Translated by Google) Nice, good for children see the different seal fish .. (Original) Nice, good for children see the different seal fish ..",4
Airport,Finding parking was a nightmare. The airport facilities are very good.,4
Museum,"If you like Wax Museums, then it'll be a fun experience for you.  Most of the wax figures look good.  A few of them are pretty bad, as far as the resemblance goes.  Overall, it's not a Madame Tussauds, but it's close enough.",4
Airport,"There's a hotel inside the airport, which is convenient for very early flight. This airport is super crowded during spring break, and probably other major holidays. Either go there very early or get a pre check to go throw the security fast.",4
Aquarium,"A wonderful place! It's crazy seeing the size of some of those creatures. The only issue is that it was way too crowded when we went. Regardless, it's a must-see!",4
Aquarium,"Everything was great, except the $70 dollar food my husband stated he wouldn't pay $2 for.",4
Zoo,Was great except the construction and lack of bathroom area.,4
Theme Park,"Extremely busy the day we went. Parked forever from the gate. Was a fun place, had great BBQ and enjoyed the magic act. Long, Long wait times for roller coasters.",4
Attraction,"Fun but then again
I would give it a 5 except unlike Disneyland toddlers can‚Äôt sit with parents on rides and we‚Äôre talking about the fun town rides that are for babies or children 5 and under and the buffet prices for adults are extreme especially with little options",4
Airport,"Nice clean airport, working outlet plugs.  Terminal B is quite small and it doesn‚Äôt have much well know restaurant.  Also remember you have to take a train to and from the tsa check point.  So add that time your departure time.",4
Theme Park,"Easy Drama-Free Fun
It was very chilly on the first day of spring, but we had a great time. Many of the rides were closed in the morning, but opened as soon as it warmed up. Low crowds and wait times.",4
AZM,Lot of nice changes happening.  Nice going to the zoo when not crowded.,4
Aquarium,Absolutely loved everything about this place.. the dolphin show was awesome.  We went on a Sunday the place was busy but we expected a crowd.,4
AZM,"10/10, would go again
Very beautiful zoo. Natural-looking, spacious exhibits. Lots of cool animals. Food was a tiny bit expensive, but decent quality.",4
Aquarium,"The animals we saw were out of this world but this place loses a star due to how small and expensive for what it was, they also made a mistake on our tickets which caused my father in law to stay behind but overall it was a nice aquarium",4
Zoo,"Going too early right when they open at 8:30am can disappoint as not all animals will be out to see. Nevertheless, it's always a great time to make the trip to the zoo.",4
Airport,Nice airport stores close too early in my opinion,4
Theme Park,Didn't open till 11am. The train ride was ok but didn't have anything special added to it. The sovineers we're high. Park was clean. Lots of walking trails. Put put golf was available. Yogi bear show in 3D was cute. Overall it's a nice place to visit for a day.,4
Theme Park,"Brilliant but need shade
Brilliant day had such a great time. Only criticism is need more shade‚Ä¶ the rides were not too busy.",4
AZM,"Nice Aquarium
Visited at 10am weekday.....fairly empty as compared to weekend.nice exhibits. Loved the shark exhibit.However dont do the glass bottom boat or the 4D Aquaman experience, its a waste of money",4

AZM,Medium sized zoo. Crowded but you won't go thirsty...there's a beer/cocktail stand every 75 feet or so. Special merit points for Bugtopia.,4
Aquarium,It was cool and fun very different a lot of people too but the only thing that stopped 5 stars was the cost of food and it wasn‚Äôt even good but other than that everything was fine,4
Zoo,"Lovely zoo, might need more supervisor in the ‚Äúsmall animals‚Äù area, kids yelling and tapping on windows a lot.",4
Theme Park,Had a blast kids loved it worker's are rude to many young kids,4
Theme Park,We had fun despite the cold rain - very cute buildings and the rides are fun. I just wish there were more Dolly Parton things to look at.,4
AZM,"My kids LOVE going to the zoo. I just wish the family pass wasn‚Äôt so much. I understand it‚Äôs for the whole year that‚Äôs what I really like about it, but for other families on a budget, I wish it was cheaper to be able to go every year.",4
Airport,"A lot of restaurants! Unfortunately in the terminal we were in they had no lounge area. So no comfy chairs anywhere. But other than that, it was a nice airport. I liked the train between terminals to minimize the amount of walking.",4
Aquarium,Pretty Awesome! And Busy!! Please go early as possible or the end of the day. Didnt get to see everything and will definitely go back!,4

Be sure to check out all levels of the aquarium. It is a large aquarium, so be sure to download a map in order to get your money's worth. Nice gift shop.",4
Attraction,"Great for children 4-12. Some rides only had 1 team member running it, which caused the lines to move a bit slower. Hours should be a bit longer since lines move slowly.

AZM,It was a good experience and very clean facility. But you better be ready to do ALOT of walking. Make sure you bring a stroller for small children. Even my older children said they were done and didn't want to walk anymore.,4
AZM,Great place highly recommended.  It was cold out but obviously that's not their fault. They have some great species on exhibit. We really enjoyed our visit and will be back.,4
Museum,We enjoyed our fifth grade field trip even though many teams were cancelled and many films were off-time. But we made the most of it. The best was the guided tour portion of our trip.,4
Theme Park,Too cold for any rides to be open. But beautiful park.  Would have been nice for them to offer maybe another day pass,4
Zoo,Great zoo. Friendly staff. They do have some exhibits closed but they are marked when they will reopen.,4

Airport,Beautiful airport but not clean bathroom which of course is expected,4
Theme Park,"Great day!
Wonderful for our 4 year old granddaughter.  It‚Äôs set up for younger children. Take bathing suits for kids so they can play in the water feature. There are changing areas. Price was higher than advertised - same price for the four-year-old as adults: almost $60.",4

AZM,The trip was fun. Disappointed that all the animals were not out where we could see them,4
Theme Park,Today was a perfect day to enjoy the park. The temperature was just right.  The lines weren't bad. The performers were wonderful. The workers all seemed to actually enjoy their jobs.,4
Theme Park,"It was great fun, even though our toddler only reaches up to 30"", the only thing we did not like is the fact that we needed to pay extra to visit the waterpark.",4

Airport,Food service is good.  Construction is a little in the way.,4
Aquarium,The actual aquarium is beautiful. Loved everything we got to see. But my draw back is how over packed it is. It seems they just sell as many tickets as they want with no real organization. Overall I did have a wonderful time but probably wouldn‚Äôt go back because it seems hazardous.,4
Attraction,"WE appreciate Legoland
We had a wonderful time however we weren't able to retrieve all of our pictures at the end of the trip. We were advised that the website and the Lego app don't ""talk to each other.""",4
Airport,"As chaotic flying is this airport has wonderful, helpful, and kind staff working. When we were trying to find our way to our gate several people stopped to help us. The tsa agents were quick with checking our boarding passes. As always you will still need to arrive a few hours early to get to your flight but as long as you have everything in order you will make your flight safely.",4
AZM,If its your thing you will enjoy. Great history lesson onSingapore.,4
Aquarium,"The place has tons of fish from different places, the great lakes and Chicago some other places to. There are field trips here which make the place even more crowded than usual. Staff are ok, amazing gift shop the layout is confusing.",4
AZM,Great visit. Zoo is awesome. Only issue was the wait for the safari ride was over an hour but they said it was going to be 30 minutes. Don‚Äôt waste your time waiting for this ride. Not worth it.,4
Aquarium,Awesome place to go but wish it was a little bit bigger,4
Aquarium,We went on a Monday and arrived as soon as they opened. It was probably the best time to go to beat the crowd we were able to hit all the free attractions in 2 hours with 3 kids. Parking is 12$ if you pay ahead 17$ if you pay there. The best deal is to buy the member pass or the ATL city pass.,4

My boyfriend and I visited last week and our trip far exceeded expectations. We had a great time despite it being out of season.",4
AZM,Some sketching at the zoo! It‚Äôs fun that there‚Äôs a whole tv show about our zoo in Tampa. I get to learn more stories about the animals and then go visit them in life. Of course the challenge with drawing live animals is they always move right when you trying to get that one detail.,4
AZM,"Zoo was pretty cool.  Selection of animals is limited, though.  The monkeys were the best part, extremely enteretaining.  They are the reason for 4 stars vice 3.",4

Some amusements and activities are not open, and the food was way too expensive. But it was a good day in Legoland and my family and me all had fun. Thank you Legoland!!",4
Museum,"Nice place, but expensive tickets for Illinois residents,",4
Aquarium,Great time and tons of fun. Just wish there were bigger walkways or some traffic flow control because people were jammed together and it was hard getting around because of it.,4
Attraction,"I thought it was fine, I just wish there was better signage at the LEGOLAND California Resort Hotel. And the park was super and they keep improving, when I went they were putting together the city of San Diego.",4
Attraction,"Legoland is a cool park. We loved all of the Lego creations throughout and enjoyed several rides. I think staffing might be low this time of year because short lines took a long time.
Our kids are tween/teen so we did everything we wanted to in a half day. Try the Apple fries‚Äîthey were great!",4
Aquarium,I love this place but I saw a few fish that looked to be unhealthy in a way. And one of the tanks in the amphibian exhibit that looked a lot bigger than his enclosureü´§,4
AZM,Good variety of sea creatures. Good for a day out with kids. Slightly overpriced.,4
Zoo,"Kids love it, not too many animals out, yet we went on a Wed and have to say it was not crowded. We got to see the elephant show at 145pm. If you want to see the lions, roar have to be there at 330pm as that's the time they are waking up.",4
Theme Park,Always enjoy the experience. Still great variety of rides. I think the price should be less when your hours are reduced though.,4
Museum,They have an amazing array of exhibits that make the whole place so diverse. You never spend a second wondering if you've already seen everything because there is always one thing to be found!,4
Theme Park,Everything is really expensive inside so bring water bottles and leave snacks in the car for the kids. Family-friendly fun for everyone. We had a great time. I am looking forward to returning with the kids soon.,4
Airport,Big airport but easy to navigate.,4
Garden,"Beautiful grounds. Okay service, not the greatest or friendliest staff, though.",4
Museum,An enormous space full of learning and excellent exhibits. Was taken aback by the paywalls to some of the exhibits.,4
AZM,A good place for the family. Try to purchase the tickets before going there to avoid the waiting.,4
Theme Park,Great rollercoasters! Some long lines. Kids rides were good.,4
Aquarium,"April 2, 2023: Spending the morning with Scuba Bunny at the aquarium! #vanaqua #explorebc #sundayfunday #scubabunny",4
AZM,Welcoming Spring time and all the sunshine with a quick visit to The Living Desert üåµ,4
AZM,(Translated by Google) Fish saw in stock (Original),4
Aquarium,"Ticket prices aren‚Äôt enough, gotta charge 10$  for parking too! Other then that, nice aquarium.",4
AZM,"What a wonderful experience ""meeting up with"" all the super stars at Madam Tussauds Hongkong. This wax models are so life-like. We certainly admire the hardwork and talent that has gone into creating this Museum.",4
Aquarium,First time visiting. Everything was amazing. Pricey as hell but that was to be expected. But lunch for 2 was $70??? What tha hell??,4
Theme Park,"Nice time to get out of the car for a walk around. Walked around the island by the covered bridge, and did the heritage square. And went around the stone on the one way road.",4
AZM,"(Translated by Google) It was decorated well, and the glass boat activity was interesting, but I couldn&#39;t help it that the price was too expensive.... (Original) It was decorated well, and the glass boat activity was interesting, but the price I couldn&#39;t help it being so expensive...",4
Airport,Clean and small enough to get there only a little before the flight but conveniently located,4
Aquarium,"Aquarium was great, but the place in general is not well thought out. Parking was unnecessary complicated and the children‚Äôs buggy‚Äôs were insane! Seriously need to consider some adult only days!!!!",4
Zoo,"Wonderful zoo to visit. Only thing is that the aquarium has some moving lights and is very loud. This was very difficult for my mom who has seizures, she almost had an episode in that part of the zoo and there is no warning on the door. So if you suffer from seizures be careful.",4
Airport,Easy to move through.  Only problem is car rental return  is too far  away,4
Theme Park,Fun all day. Bathrooms need much to improve on with being cleaned more often.,4
Airport,"A huge airport with many dining and concession options. Cokes and fairly easy to navigate. Even though there‚Äôs several automated trains, you‚Äôre going to do a considerable amount of walking.",4
