Airport,"Absolutely atrocious. If I could give zero stars, I would. The staff is rude and inefficient, despite a recording that plays stating that this airport is the most efficient. TSA Pre-Check is not operated according to the guidelines necessary, and the airport is set up so poorly.",1
Airport,"Almost all the restaurants close about 3 so if you like eating past then or have a plane coming in after that, you won't like ATL.",1
Airport,"8pm Sunday evening and ALL restaurants are closed!!!
International airport and Delta hub.",1
Airport,"It was a Night mare,in every way possible.",1
Airport,"Always busy, wait times are terrible.",1
Airport,Very busy with no stopping had to ride the loop twice because of passenger delays and no wheelchair access to help passenger.,1
Airport,You say you are following CDC guidelines and yet I see most food service employees and management is not. I know that I am back in the states where stupidity rules. Please make a real effort to protect the public.,1
Airport,Your lucky if your plane is fit to fly out of this airport. This is the second time in a month we've had an issue with an our  plane. Flying Delta who is watching out for maintenance on these planes,1
Airport,The staff that works for Spirit Airlines is very rude! The one with the nappy wig was yelling for no reason at passengers. The staff also needs to rearrange how they have their line.,1
Airport,Very unorganized and bad customer support,1
Airport,bad customer service and information/ doesn‚Äôt make any sense to one of the biggest airports in the world,1
Airport,I've been waiting for my checked bag for 2 hours now. What is going on? Fix it. I don't ever want to check another bag through this airport again. Here's an idea. How about paying people a fair wage so that you won't have a labor shortage every week?,1
Airport,Too big and confusing. The staff at security are Very rude,1
Airport,"Slow and abrasive security checkpoint that's way too serious and kind of rude for such a small, ""international"" airport.",1
Airport,"Confusing directions, awful traffic, and will avoid in future",1
Airport,"Worst airport I‚Äôve ever been in, it‚Äôs no wonder the traveling public is getting more aggressive.",1
Airport,My wife and I traveled from ATL back home to Philly Monday night. We noticed our suitcase was literally the very last suitcase to come up. One of our friends we traveled with notified us that his sneakers was stolen from his suitcase. I jumped up checked our suitcase case sure enough my wife sneakers GONEüò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨. We took 5 trips this year never had an issue come to ATL stuff stolen..,1
Airport,It‚Äôs 7:30pm and ALL food options at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport are closed for the night. How is this even possible?!? Are that many people not working that you can‚Äôt reopen the food options here? Absolutely ridiculous.,1
Airport,To many people took 2hrs to get through tsa,1
Airport,Very frustrating airport!  All restaurants close at 745pm or 8pm.  Long lines and waited in 2 lines and when I got close they both closed with about 10-15 people waiting.  No posted hours on the restaurants.,1
Airport,"7:00 pm and food services are either closed or only serving alcohol. Fast food places and the ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù stores have lines out the door and into the major walkway, just to check out. It‚Äôs also hot and humid inside. I guess they‚Äôre trying to save $$$ due to Covid-19. Horrible experience",1
Airport,"Super frustrating- No stores, coffee shops, or restaurants are open after 8. Do not fly in here late as everything is closed. You might come across an open place but they are short on capacity due to covid and have waiting lines over an hour long. Nothing worse than flying all day, and not being able to get dinner and still having another flight after.",1
Airport,Rude attendant lectured me on bag policy. Refusing to listen to me and  then insulting my intelligence. After failing to realize she was in the wrong she continued to be not just rude but very rude. Learn better hospitality or teach better hospitality.,1
Airport,How does everything close down at 9pm at one of the busiest airports in the US. I was at gate E and I couldn‚Äôt even find a place to buy a water. Smh,1
Airport,Such when the airline promise hotel and no hotel available,1
Airport,"Canceled flight, no other options.  Lost luggage.  Ruined vacation.",1
Airport,"The absolute worst Airport!!! üò´
Not very clean and shops/restaurants closed before 8pm. Staff is very short tempted!  I neva would recommend going to this Airport!",1
Airport,2nd time I've left this airport without my luggage to take home and staff can never tell you what happened. We waited nearly 2 hours for our luggage at the international baggage claim and it never showed up. We had to run to catch our next flight so we'd at least it make home.,1
Airport,Had 2 hour layovers both ways. Everyplace was closed. Extremely disappointing.,1
Airport,"Many shops closed. Coffee shop understaffed so long wait and no selection. Food items overpriced. When one hour layover turned into four,,; forced to wait in long lines and pay lots of money for yucky coffee.",1
Airport,"Two weeks in a row there was serious issues with getting into our gates, both times almost missing connections. I also think that closing all food outlets at 9pm when you have so many customs flying in and out even past 1030p is very frustrating and very poor though process. At least try to keep one thing open for late flyers.",1
Airport,The south side (delta) traffic management is struggling. Additionally people parking in the traffic lanes waiting for arrivals is way out of hand. Bottom line it won't improve until adequate traffic management is in place.,1
Airport,The worst airport I've ever had the misfortune to have to go to,1
Airport,The security process is so ridiculous!! To have people walk in a sickening maze just to wait 15 minutes more to get through... Utterly ridiculousüò•üò•,1
Airport,insane week‚Ä¶ special s/o to pax for trying to teach me to play :|,1
Airport,Absolutely disgusting as usual.  At least it's consistent.,1
Airport,"The tsa pre check and clear lines are getting the worse and worse. 
I spend minimum 30 minutes in priority lanes! The wait goes time every time I travel.",1
Airport,Park your car to get it stolen! Talk about the sense of safety and security while you travel! Beyond disgusted with how your management team handles the parking situation in your garage sand beyond disappointed to know that there are NO CAMERAS in 2021!! Come on delta! As a DIAMOND MEMBER I expect better than this!!,1
Airport,Southwest was so unprofessional !! The line was ridiculous !! TSA was long but the line very quickly..,1
Airport,"Food needs to be available after 10p in the B Concourse. Many of the employees seem to have a chip on their shoulder and an attitude.  Not fond of the train you have to take from Concourse to Concourse although it is fast. Overall, I try to avoid this airport if possible.",1
Airport,"Why is there nothing open for food at 7:45 pm with a concourse full of people all looking for dinner? Absolutely ridiculous! People are traveling again, they need to eat!",1
Airport,International line was long. No pre- check line... no clear line on this side ! Sad,1
Airport,"Avoid TGIF, dirty tables, bad avocados, yucky salad.",1
Airport,Nothing open for breakfast before 7 am.,1
Airport,"In the international terminal, all the restaurants were closed by 7pm. Myself and about 15 other people were in disbelief looking for a place to eat. We were told to go to another concourse if we wanted food. They do have a Hudsons where we were able to grab some snacks.",1
Airport,Terrible service and it stinks!,1
Airport,Everything is closed by 9:45 pm,1
Airport,Always slow and behind schedule.,1
Airport,Very difficult to sign on DL wifi!,1
Airport,Extremely crowded and full of covid so I gave it 5 stars,1
Airport,"Even though satisfied the need. They should think on building a multilevel parking garage. The demand for parking is big, the space is suffice,  but the infrastructure sucks. Come on California set a better plan for this airport needs.",1
Airport,"Ya'd think Covid wasn't a thing at this airport. Signs are posted, but 0 enforcement of masking unlike any major airport in the US. If I didn't have to, I'd never fly through ATL again. Thumbs down.",1
Airport,What is the point of having Global Entry and having bags tagged as Priority and then waiting more than 20 minutes for the bags to come out at baggage claim?!! We had to run to make our connection!,1
Airport,Almost missed our flight because the ticket scanner and monitor had us going to the wrong gate.,1
Airport,"Why do some people have to be so hateful, over a bottled water if forgot to take out, I feel like I was in jail, then trying to see why I had that, I‚Äôm sorry, I forgot, but they could have been nice about it!",1
Airport,Nice clean airport but rudest tsa I've ever seen,1
Airport,Please be careful on the train üöÇ. The train close up on me. I thought I was going to died. It took 3 people to get the door off me.,1
Airport,Not pleasant. Nothing is open early in the morning. You can't bring in food and then everything is closed.,1
Airport,"80 percent chance to get covid 19.
Few masks and most of those üëÉ not covered",1
Airport,Luggage was very slow receiving.,1
Airport,It wasn't the cleanest airport I've been in. The service at three of the four eating establishments tried by people in my party was horrible.,1
Airport,"This airport is logistically inefficient.  TSA pre check isn't a guarantee that you will move through lines faster.  They sent us to the wrong line resulting in having to remove everything.  This delayed us causing unnecessary distress. They need to retrain everyone working the security, particularly in the customer service area.",1
Airport,Wow... don't fly in to ATL on an international flight.  Unless you have a 3-4 hour layover...,1
Airport,One of the worst airports in the states. Always congested and poor customer services by the airlines agents,1
Airport,"Retrain your TSA not to treat people who are obviously coming to spend hard earned money hunting in the great state of Texas like domestic terrorists. Absolutely horrific and aggressive experience. They will profile you, harass, and dehumanize you. Borderline hatecrime.",1
Airport,This airport is one of the worst airports ever. TSA line makes you want to pull your hair out. The people checking IDs and Tickets make the process so long and the attitudes are so nasty. It's like they are upset they filled out a application and got the JOB.  It could be better handled so the process can be seamless. The TSA line is completely messy.,1
Airport,"Disappointing food selection in terminal E and none of the gates had seating with desk or table surfaces (unlike SFO, BOS, etc). Also just takes a long time to get from MARTA to security and then from security to any of the terminals",1
Airport,The people outside with the flashing lights were quite rude and barely spoke well articulated English. Not horrible tho,1
Airport,"Airport is nice but had a terrible experience with a Delta gate agent on a power trip who was having a bad day. Disrespectful, condescending and confrontational from the first question asked.",1
Airport,"Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport What a joke this place has become! Tonight and the last time through here, there is nothing open. And,  it's not like our flights are late. It's ridiculous.  If the airport is open, there needs to be plenty open so you can get something decent to eat. Going forward,  going to try my best not to come through here.",1
Airport,An hour and a half to leave the airport??!! That was the same amount of time the flight took. INVEST in placing directional signs that are placed at easy to see levels. That also goes for the signs outside for OFF GROUNDS PARKING.,1
Airport,Rediculous cancelled my flight for 24 hours,1
Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport your TSA is an embarrassment‚Ä¶ just watched 2 TSA agents mock and ridicule an elderly couple because they couldn‚Äôt hear in a loud terminal. Have some freaking humanity‚Ä¶Ôøº,1
Airport,Lack of signs when was driving to Airport and entrance was a nightmare with the information and signing,1
Airport,"Worst TSA experience ever. Super long line. 1 agent, auto bag scan dysfunctional. Waiting on the other side of screening for my bag almost 5 min‚Ä¶ still no bag. Expensive machines, no operators, epic fail.",1
Airport,Keep your smoking areas. It's was the only thing that made this dirty nasty over priced airport worth stopping in.,1
Airport,"Food choices in International Terminal in early AM flights are pretty bad. There's only, let's see, o yeah Starbucks open.",1
Airport,"Why are the Delta Air Lines  male gate agents in the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport so damn rude? Every single time? I walk up to the desk to this sassy gate agent and he kept talking to his other sassy friend, then turned to me like I was bothering his convo.  I just heard One tell his passengers don‚Äôt even come up üòÇüòÇüòÇ as I was passing by.",1
Airport,"What a pathetic joke of an airport. Dirty, 8pm the place is full of passengers and half the restaurants are closed.  The few fast food places open have 30 min plus waits.",1
Airport,To be a International Hub.. It is a horrible airport.   Don't show up early.. there is no where sitting..,1
Airport,7.30 on a Sunday evening and at least half of the eateries were closed. Dinner of Doritos and Diet Coke!,1
Airport,Nothing open to eat at the international terminal all restaurants open at 12 noon.Starbucks was the only place which didn't even have coffee available only refreshers and Fraps because it was so busy there. HUDSON News has sandwich and lunch lunchable type food.. so eat before going to airport.,1
Airport,Terrible!!!   They need to take down the sign on the wrong side that says shuttle. We were waiting 45 min. My brother is in the hospital dying. Hanging by a thread.,1
Airport,ATL airport needs to open up vendors to their night travelers. Sitting here at 11:52PM in the foodcourt just outside the South Checkpoint and not one open vendor or even a vending machine around. Not great customer service at all.,1
Airport,"I'll avoid this airport at all costs.  2 people working at Customs and Borders protection with over 1,000 people awaiting to catch connections.... none of them cares whether they moved people through quickly or not.  Then,  there's no restaurants or places to get food after several long flights.... Staff at airport was horrible... avoid this airport at all costs",1
Airport,Nobody loves the Atlanta airport for the amenities or for the cleanliness. Their bathrooms are always dirty and they never have paper towels. Also don‚Äôt expect the non-touch faucets to actually work. It‚Äôs a big airport and it‚Äôs a hub for a lot of airlines so you are forced to come here. Would not crack my top 15 airports in the country though.,1
Airport,Absolutely a terrible experience!  This airport is not set up to manage the amount of people that go thru here! If i never have to go thru this place again it will be too soon!,1
Airport,"Confusing to navigate, no stars",1
Airport,terminal c needs a good cleaning tonight.no food all restaurants closed at 7:30 what is that.,1
Airport,"Security are very slow, unless you are parked at the loading and unloading area they are quick to give you a ticket and security is very rude and unprofessional.",1
Airport,"I took a 5:30a flight to Hartford, CT. And arrived at 3:50a. Security check is a nightmare at that time  of the day! One agent to check IDs and one counter to check bags! There must have been 200 people trying to pass through security! Make sure you plan 1 hour minimum to get through security that early in the morning. And, no pre line. Doesn't open till 5am.",1
Airport,"Horrible airport,  WAAAY TO BIG. TOO MUCH TRAFFIC AND ALWAYS EXPENSIVE TICKETS
I never understand why they don't make another airport north of Atlanta.",1
Airport,"I I'm very unhappy with this place I went to my gate to board my flight about 20 minutes early everybody was gone they told me oh it started leaving 10 minutes early but yet I had different, my ticket they said sorry for your luck here's another black going out 2 hours layover very upset",1
Airport,Nothing open for food after 7pm except two fast food counters with really long lines‚Ä¶when did it become hard to eat at the airport?!?,1
Airport,"If you are disabled this is NOT the time to fly. Not sure if it ever will be. My partner and I Have flown multiple times since reopening and the company they partner with are not staffed well. There must be a solution, someone needs to care about those with disabilities and it starts with us.",1
Airport,Worst airport ever. 60 mins for security check!!,1
Airport,Terrible bus service.  Not enough drivers. Terrible communication and signage.,1
Airport,AWFUL Airport they stole from my checked luggage will not fly out of here again.,1
Airport,"First time reviewing an airport...Terrible TSA staff running TSA pre. Took far too long, very unorganized and to top it off they were fairly rude to just about everyone and keep saying ""just let me do my job"". If their job is to make travel even worse they are definitely excelling...",1
Airport,I hate this place.  Most of the restaurants are CLOSED most of the time so if you are hungry and have a 3Hour layover you have to stand in line with 200 other people to get a $15 ham sandwich.  No issues for me with the restrooms but everything else is terrible.,1
Airport,I wish I has two more hands so I could give Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport four thumbs down. This place is joke.,1
Airport,Worst major city Airport in America.,1
Airport,"An international airport where all of the restaurants are closed by 7 and 8pm??? I‚Äôve never seen so many hungry, dumbfounded travelers. Truly. I really felt bad for people who had kids to feed.",1
Airport,"At 8pm on a Saturday evening most places where closed.  Those that where open were out of food and/or drinks and didnt want to fix new.  Way too early in the night for a major airport to be shuttjng down.

Trashcans were also overflowing and there is not seating near the food. This was all in terminal A",1
Airport,"TSA not friendly. 
I parked my car there for 2 weeks to go out of state and came back found it hit and damaged. Whoever hit my car (Black RAV4) please speak up. 

I will never be traveling through Atlanta again",1
Airport,"TSA not friendly. 
I parked my car there for 2 weeks to go out of state and came back found it hit and damaged. Whoever hit my car (Black RAV4) please speak up. 

I will never be traveling through Atlanta again",1
Airport,"I hate using this airport. I have traveled through the airports in Amsterdam, Barcelona, and Rome this week and all their shops and restaurants were open. This is the second time this month in Atlanta and only a couple stores are open.",1
Airport,"One of the most complicated airports you will ever be in. LaGuardia, JFK and LAX are MUCH easier to navigate than this airport",1
Airport,"The black lady ""helping"" at the check in kiosk refused to assist us and then refused again. She forced us to miss our flight (first class) and I had to get a new flight in economy. DO NOT FLY UNITED.",1
Airport,Security was okay but Alejandra in the car rentals was EXTREMELY rude. Because I didn't have a credit card she started talking to me slowly like I was dumb and didn't understand. She basically walked off as soon as my credit ran through and didn't let me get a car. Worst type of person to be working in customer service.,1
Airport,So.....concourse C. As of 9 pm EST there are NO FOOD vendors or food concessions open what so ever! Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport how in the hell  do you allow this to happen? Pretty sure several of the thousand or so travelers have medicine to take.....just saying.,1
Airport,All restaurants and shops closed at 9pm!! Landed and no place to eat. Horrible!!,1
Airport,Oh my god. I wish I could leave zero stars. Worst. Airport. Ever. DONT FLY OUT OF HERE. There are a lot of other airports near this one. You‚Äôre better off with one of those. This airport was just bad in literally every area.,1
Airport,"Long lines, unfriendly but hey, at least we didn't get robbed.",1
Airport,Unfriendly staff... They didn't provide useful information,1
Airport,"Some sort of shooting event at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport 

unclear what has happened but initial reports are of it being an ""active shooter""..

other initial reports are of someone running past security check points and guards shot...

either way it appears Terminals (at least one) has been evacuated to the Tarmac.",1
Airport,"Sat Nov 20, 2021

Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the ghetto. Hate it here. Will definitely avoid this airport at all cost moving forward.,1
Airport,I woulda hate to be in Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport today ‚Ä¶üò©,1
Airport,"Anyone else get stuck in the gun shooting mess at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport? It was complete chaos. Shut down the busiest airport in the world! 
But look at the sunset we had üòç",1
Airport,It was a bad day to travel thru Atlanta intl.. stayed stuck for 3 or 4 hours  inside,1
Airport,Who thinks it is ok to EVER close TSA precheck. What a clusterf%@$.,1
Airport,Everything close‚Äôs at 8:00.The people who work there are rude and nasty.Now it‚Äôs just a dirty airport.If you can skip this airport.It used to be one of the bettor airports.I guess the people of Atlanta who work there don‚Äôt care bout their city.,1
Airport,"One of the worst airports I've every gone through, not enough seats to wait at your gate and not enough places to grab a bite to eat with out waiting over an hour",1
Airport,"Hope your airline doesn‚Äôt leave you stranded here overnight. You will starve to death. And their website will tease you by listing restaurants that supposedly open at 5, and when you trek 3 terminals down, the workers setting up snarl at you that they don‚Äôt open until 7. The place is a filthy dump, and the restrooms are pretty gross. I will do my best to never come back here.",1
Airport,"To be the ""best and most efficient"" airport you should at least have automated passport control. I spent time filling out information in the official CBP app in the plane, only too find out that ATL is probably the only major airport in the country that doesn't accept it",1
Airport,I will not fly out of Atlanta ever again!,1
Airport,I would suggest arriving at least 2-3 hrs early in order to not rush to your flight as lines are terribly long. That is no exaggeration. Also this is by far my worst experience with TSA. They talk to you as if your in inmate in a prison. Some delta tellers were nice but overall a really bad experience,1
Airport,Man me and my brothers was at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when shots was fired yesterday‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still in shock of what took place ! But my God is a protector and his blood covered us!!! Today is not promised üôèüèæ live like it‚Äôs your last time on earth. I‚Äôm so grateful to be back home safely.,1
Airport,Not enough staff to support the early morning flights. It's 5:45 and only one person is behind the counter for a long line of people. Mobile orders are taking priority but the app won't let me order a non-dairy latte! So frustrating after a 45 min wait I had to walk away.,1
Airport,Fist off flight are still landing between 6pm and 9pm why would you close all but one food spot on D side 6pm is still early the burger place we‚Äôre under staff so they stop serving and non of the 3 drink vending machines worked but yet charged me for each transaction and I have children and yet you won‚Äôt take cash terrible,1
Airport,"Soooooo many people, including employees, not wearing masks or wearing them incorrectly!  I don‚Äôt feel safe here!",1
Airport,Traffic. Is a nightmare cops are just park not telling cars to move.,1
Airport,"The BIGGEST and BUSIEST airport in THE WORLD!
But I cannot buy food after 7pm because of staffing?
That's just a joke. Traveling all day and not being able to buy anything, not even snacks is unheard of.",1
Airport,No where to eat or have a drink after 7pm......,1
Airport,No vending or food areas in International Arrivals hall were open at 1900,1
Airport,Dirty...not as sanitary as they say...didn't see anyone cleaning and I was at this airport for 5 hrs.,1

Airport,"My 16 and 14 year old are on a layover in Atlanta and stores inside the airport won't accept cash for transactions. Ridiculous, it's a legal tender.

A PILOT swiped his card for my kids to grab food today, blessings to that man, shame on the rest od the airport.",1
Airport,"why would stores inside the airport not be accepting cash for goods? I had family go through there today with nothing but cash on hand and were unable to get food from the Starbucks with cash. it's legal tender, unstuck your head from your 4th point of contact.

p.s. thank you to the pilot who swiped his card for my family.",1
Airport,This airport‚Äôs kiosks wouldn‚Äôt accept cash for food for 14 and 16 year olds that didn‚Äôt have a card to pay with. A pilot was kind enough to swipe his card for them. They accepted cash there a week ago.,1
Airport,Don't lose your parking ticket! A twenty minute stop to let your spouse unload their luggage and say goodbye to you and your kids can turn into a $40 fine. And they do not care if it was under an hour.,1
Airport,Security is so slow I feel like I‚Äôm gonna miss my flight.,1
Airport,"This will make you happy if you didn't fly today!
Here's a #timelapse of the security lines basically from start to finish at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport 
Wait times earlier were up ~1.5 hours at the main security checkpoint.
But only 42 flights canceled and few if any weather impacts at the airports.  We're live on The Weather Channel",1
Airport,"I truly hate this airport, just seems unorganized and chaotic",1
Airport,"My Gf is currently trying to Get home, her flight has been delayed causing her to miss her connecting flight, and they have done very little to help right thier wrong. She is beyond stressed and i am incredibly agitated, as an airport you recieve good funding, and its your 1 job to keep flights on track. Do your job",1
Airport,"ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS AIRPORT! Getting in and out is like pulling teeth!  From the horrendous Lyft prices to the ""hurry up and wait"" on the runway with the airlines.  THROW THE WHOLE AIRPORT AWAY!",1
Airport,"24/7 international Airport...yet no food service after 9pm. The two restaurants I found that were open in A concourse were out of most food. People were queued up down the hallways to try to get to the vending machines. Chaos. If traveling through here, plan accordingly.",1
Airport,"Got there 2 hours early to my flight. It was so backed up that it took 2 hours to get through baggage check in and TSA. The plane left 5 minutes early.  We missed the flight.  Had the flight left on time, we would've made that flight and wouldn't have had to wait 4 hours in the airport with tons of people.",1
Airport,The new Uber pickup situation is absolutely asinine! The restaurants all close early so you can‚Äôt even get a meal if you land past 9pm. I‚Äôm from ATL and that was an embarrassingly horrible landing experience.,1
Airport,Terrible security took way too long it made me miss My flight ‚úà,1
Airport,Understaffed for people who need wheel chairs,1
Airport,These TSA pre check lines are always longer than any other airport. The typically merge the entire airport TSA pre check lines together which can be annoying,1
Airport,"Coming back from
Bogota security was unnecessarily harsh with me for no reason. They were harsh in tone, somewhat verbally abusive, and had no kindness. Gave me a lot of anxiety and made me feel unwelcome in my own country.",1
Airport,Long delays in immigration counters.,1

Airport,No TSA PRECHECK.  Massive lines. Restaurants closed at 9pm.  I hate ATL. The worst.,1
Airport,As usual it never fails. The rudeness is unbearable.,1
Airport,Directions and signs are not well done.,1
Airport,No bracelets for you customers taking off for Maui today. Our flight left at 11:30 a.m. As all the others are going for their rental cars we're stuck here in a huge line because of lack of personnel. üò°,1
Airport,Your Organization with partners needs serious attention,1
Airport,"Heartbroken that my 8 year old niece had to push her Grandmother through the airport. After taking 3 HOURS to get through security, they missed their flight!! My niece is traumatized and doesn't want to fly anymore!!! So kudos to you all for ruining her first flight experience!!!!",1
Airport,I am disappointed that almost all restaurants were closed at 8. We come from different time zones. The very few places were outrageously crowded. This is such a busy airport and they are NOT serving their customers!,1
Airport,Restaurants not open. Couldn't get a cup of coffee. It's no wonder people seem angry on flights these says.,1
Airport,Getting worse. Airports should put pressure on the Federal government to remove the mask mandate.,1
Airport,"The service was pitiful, I definitely will choose not to travel to Atlanta again. The customer service was very bad the wheel chair employees needs more training.",1
Airport,"Terminal F Starbucks is the worst service ever again.  Staff is rude except for the young lady making the breakfast sandwiches, she was doing her best.  Other than that Atlanta Airport is one of the best!",1
Airport,"This place is a disaster. I got to the airport at 4:30am, took 50 minutes till they got me to the terminal. Thank you parking team for having zero sense or urgency for people trying to catch flights. I‚Äôll never use this ever ever again.",1
Airport,Worst airport I've ever been to. Total chaos from arrival to departure.,1
Airport,"Do you like an 80¬∞ incubator, overcrowded, wth barely anyone wearing a mask properly?  Do you enjoy it when no matter where you land, you have to take a train to the other side of the airport can make a connection?  Atlanta airport is not a fun place to be.  Every time I go through it, I think... Why didn't I just drive?",1
Airport,ALT AIRPORT is not awake! Poor customer service. Food vender closed with extreamly long lines during Thanksgiving travel! For a busy hub likevALT why are they closing down key food places. Will not travel through ALT again until they clean up their act. Even vending machines had 15 minute long line!,1
Airport,"Felt like I was in a Walmart while at customs; 20 lanes but only 2 were open. The line ran all the way back to the escalators. Took over an hour to get through. Then the security check point back to the terminals only had 2 lanes open. Better hope you have at least 2 hours between your international flight and your connection, else you're SOL.",1
Airport,Hated it. Could not find information on flight changes or hear updates in Food Court. Ridiculous and Unbelievable.,1
Airport,THE GPS ISN'T CLEAR ABOUT SELECTING DEPARTURES THEN ONCE YOU SEE THE SIGN ITS LAST MINUTE!!!!!!!!!!,1
Airport,Not enough seating at restaurants to accommodate the amount of people at the airport and the train between terminals takes too long to arrive.,1
Airport,"There is a huge problem with ventilation inside the main baggage claim terminal as well as the underground corridor that connects the terminals.  You can smell the exhaust from the airplanes inside these places and I hope they are looking into the source and cause, before any more serious issues due to CO2 or other dangerous gases.",1
Airport,This airport takes a hour and a half to go through checking. Missed my first flight because of it. I recommen you get to the airport 3 hours early.,1
Airport,You'd think the world's busiest airport would have a single restaurant open. You'd be wrong.,1
Airport,Airplanes are too LOUD and fly to low. They need to move the airport out of the city. The building is too small for all the passengers and all the flights. International planes would be devastating to the city with covid pandemic please don't do it. Also American airlines first class morning agents are rude and slow.,1
Airport,Idc how many times I do it Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Atlanta traffic ALWAYS mess with my anxiety ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚úà,1

Airport,Horrible experience. No one directing traffic on the North side in the middle of the night so the cars were literally not moving if they didn't have to.

Airport,"I live in Austin, but fly through ATL often. Today I had to go through security at ATL. It was the worst, most inefficient process I've been through. There was no CLEAR or Pre Check.

Airport,Moving shuttles and ubers to domestic makes the process far more complicated and difficult.,1
Airport,This airport tolerates animal abuse.  My friend was traveling with her cat. She went through the X-ray with her animal and before she had a chance to take it out of the bag ONE OF YOUR TSA AGENTS SHOVED HER CAT ON TO THE FLOOR WHILE IT WAS STILL IN THE BAG. Really disgusting behavior,1

Airport,Food options in gate B are brutal if you‚Äôre plant based.,1
Airport,"Dirty, smelly, crowded, uncomfortable. Almost all food operations are closed leading to unimaginably long lines at the few places that are open. The muzak over the speakers is awful and never stops. TSA is curt, slow, and responds to any deviation with yelling.

The state needs to take this airport over because the city is doing a terrible job.,1

Airport,Bathrooms are closed at night for some reason and there is zero food whatsoever.,1
Airport,"I will make sure I never fly to or out of this airport ever again.

Nobody told us there is more than one carousel 1!",1

Also not happy with the long tram rides to different concourses.",1
Airport,This airport is the absolute worst. Half the restaurant/shops on the concourse aren‚Äôt even open. Security was a nightmare. We are Clear members but still got held up at security bc they were pushing bags over to be inspected YET NO ONE WAS INSPECTING THEM?! Multiple passengers were agitated bc they were late for the flights due to this. None of the TSA workers were helpful during any of this.,1
Airport,Some of us are deaf. Like really deaf amd can't hear security when you are being barked at. Learn some sign for your deaf guests. We're not all able to hear your rudeness. Do better ATL.,1
Airport,Not an airport that makes traveling convenient for people!! Not impressed. Even called customer service and there is nothing they can do. Was going to get a drink and some food but I rather be hungry then spend any more $$$ at this airport.,1
Airport,everything is closed at 12:30 this is bullshit,1
Airport,Security line was a nightmare. Took forever and tsa pre check wasn't open. Understaffed and the staff they had didn't know what they were doing.,1
Airport,"The staff were rude even for me, and I'm from DC! When you'd ask someone for directions or just general help, the response would be as if you were bothering them or that you're stupid for asking...I'll never go to Atlanta again!",1
Airport,"Ground transportation is awful, seriously un-organized and inadequet.   This should get attention right away.",1
Airport,"This airport sucks. We arrived around 6pm on a layover and I figured, we could check out the shops while here. All the specialty shops were CLOSED. It wasnt even 7pm and this was a Monday. Then even their news shops were closed. The airport was full. Lots of travelers. There restaurants had open bars but closed kitchens...ugh!!! Disappointed ATL....VERY DISAPPOINTED!",1
Airport,Waited 45 minutes for an acknowledgement of my existence at the KLM check-in desks. They are still understaffed.,1
Airport,Asked 3 employees where to go get my Lyft ride. All 3 tell me the wrong directions. A mile of walking (not kidding) and an hour later I got into the car. Hate. Will never rendezvous at the airport ever again.,1
Airport,I hated it. The way they do their security with your laptop is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. their rude and they yell at you while you're standing in line even at 4:30 in the morning!!! My laptop came out of the bin 4 trays later....2 trays after that my laptop case ..,1
Airport,"By far the most terrible airport to travel in and out of. Unfortunately I‚Äôm currently based in Atlanta and whenever I have to travel I dread going to ATL Int‚Äô Airport. I yet to have a decent experience. I thought DTW was bad but this airport superseded and is the worst. It‚Äôs a nice looking airport, besides that unprofessional rude workers is all this airport hires.",1
Airport,It‚Äôs hard to believe that an international air shuts down at 10pm. If you travel at night don‚Äôt expect to find anything to eat other than vending machines.,1
Airport,Items were stolen out of my checked bag by southwest TSA staff. The items were two purses (both of which were not expensive at all) and a pet carrier. One my purses has my work badge in it. The other purses were completely empty so I‚Äôm not sure why staff would take them. I filed a claim and will try to go back there this week to at least see if my pet carrier is there. I‚Äôm disappointed.,1
Airport,It doesn't have the proper orientation.,1
Airport,"This airport is laid out horribly with even worse direction signage. One way in and out of baggage claim area, traffic jams at every plane train exit, just straight hot trash.",1
Airport,"I went thru  the gate heading to my  destination fine , no problems  coming back home was different  they opened my bag and took out stuff I came home with the same stuff I went with how can one airport not take stuff but another does shouldn‚Äôt they all be on the same page  I had over 25.00 worth of personal stuff taken from me I was not happy",1

Airport,Probably ok if domestic but horrible for international. Take a bus to get your luggage. Take a bus to rent a car....arrive around lunchtime and you will be 2 hours get out airport. Disaster,1
Airport,No food or drink spots open after sunset on the terminals. Absurd.,1
Airport,No food options for travellers coming into the airport after 10 pm. At least have some pick and go options for travellers at such a big airport. Bad compared to European and other airports around the world.,1
Airport,Had a very terrible experience with Advantage Car Rental. They are the worst. Poor or non-existing customer service. Lack of empathy. Never again!!,1
Airport,This is the most incompetently run airport in the U.S.,1
Airport,"One of the worst airport I've been to. The international terminal lacks seating. There were two giant sections blocked off for wheel chairs only, meanwhile....no wheelchairs in sight. Staff is incompetent and rude. I asked one airport employee for directions, he waved his hand while walking and said ""I don't know"" while not even stopping.",1
Airport,5pm on a Saturday night and most of the food closed.,1
Airport,It takes longer to get out of this airport with your bag and a rental car than it takes to fly into it.,1
Airport,Took 3 days for my girlfriend to get her luggage back and we had to drive an hour and a half to go to the Sacramento Airport run around after run around and around it was pretty disappointing if you ask me I'm going to come up to Vail to tell kids gift doesn't know where building is,1
Airport,"This airport has a very confusing design for cars. Research your terminal before you drive there because the road signs are small, not very well placed, and have incomplete info.",1
Airport,Worst airport I have seen in my life they all recist against non us sitizens we waited 6hours in a Que and then had to sleep at the airport to get on to the flight the next day,1
Airport,"Every shop is closed or the employees are rushing to before 9pm. Easily a thousand passengers in C terminal and no where to eat. How about the airlines, the airport, the restaurants figure it out. Our tax dollars bailed you all out. It's the least you can do for us!",1
Airport,"Free WiFi is erratic and nearly unusable. If an airport can't figure out how to provide reliable internet, it makes you wonder what else they can't get right.",1
Airport,"Marvin from the American Airlines customer service desk is extremely unprofessional, and very rude. I had asked him for a simple request, that ended in an unnecessary altercation. He then processed to throw his hand in my face. This occurred on Friday 3/4/22 at 3:30 P.M. I will be filling a report. Properly training your employees will go a long way.",1
Airport,"All the restaurants and stores close at 9p.m.  At least have a few options open, lots of people here on connecting flights.",1
Airport,"No options for food after 9pm on a Sunday. The vending machines were all empty of water, and there were no stores to even grab a snack. It was still very busy at that time of day so I don't understand why passengers are not given any options.",1
Airport,"Who's the genius that decided to put cones through the upper level south terminal pickup/drop off lanes? Everything else at this airport is top notch, but that was not a smart move. Had to go around twice because the officers wouldn't let me stop to pickup my passengers....in the pick up/drop off lanes. The resulting traffic was ridiculous! Come on Hartsfield Jackson, you're better than this!",1

Airport,"Lines are long, causing you to miss your flight when you arrive an hour and a half before your flight! The staff is rude and does not care. In C terminal there is no food available besides starbucks at 8:00am, which causes another long line.",1
Airport,What an absolute piece of dog s%^+ of an airport. It's 8pm on a saturday and most of the airports are closed while the cocky employees scoff And send you away. Atlanta airport is the worst par of this miserable city.,1
Airport,Noooooooo...the food and the service was horrible. The staff was very rude. The crispy bacon was soggy and nothing but fat. The bagel was hard on one side and mushy on the other. Very Expensive and I was unable to eat it. There was no coffee ready at 8:30am. They had other people returning food at the counter when I went to the counter for napkins. Do Not eat here if you don't have to.,1
Airport,"Ordered breakfast; extremely poor service and attitude from entire staff. Obviously was not prepared to open, food, coffee and utensils not ready and customers suffered long waits and aggravated work staff. For the prices paid for regular food items, absolutely unacceptable!",1
Airport,Absolutely horrible.  Everyone waited over an hour for bags with no explanation.,1
Airport,Unacceptable Delta Air Lines and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport!  Passengers have been waiting over an hour for their bags at 1:55 am.  My bags are still on the airplane.  Beyond tired and frustrated after flight delayed taking off 2 hours late from LGA and now this.,1
Airport,Landed in ATL Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at 8:30am this morning to a cancelled flight to Orlando.  Have been waiting on our checked bag since then and still have to drive to Orlando.  Whhyyyyyy is it taking so long to get our bag to baggage claim? üò≠,1
Airport,"This used to be my fav hub. When my flight was delayed not once but TWICE I was like cool delta lounge, theirs is the best. Landed and I was delayed two more times but Delta lounge AND everythingggggg else closes by 1030!?!?!? And I can't get a hotel? Total crap. I used to totally divert flying through JFK but now it's absolutely ATL. Terrible.",1
Airport,"One of the busiest airports around and its impossible to get food, why have everything close at 7pm? I'd rather take my layovers in msp than come to this hell hole again.",1
Airport,everytime we fly out of here.... all the restaurants stop serving food at 7 p.m.!!!!!! yet there are flights leaving until 11 a.m.!!!!! wth??!?!!!?,1
Airport,No traffic control for pick ups!,1
Airport,"Worst airport in the country! Connecting flights to and from our destination were delayed, restaurants closed 30+ minutes early and employees argued with upset travelers that just wanted a drink.

Update after Airport response:
Your list of restaurants does not matter when they close whenever they feel like it! The only thing worse than bad service is a tone-deaf reply.",1
Airport,"It‚Äôs the busiest airport but has nothing opened after 10pm??? You can get a pair of head phones out a vending machine and not a single piece of food. Not a water, not a bag of chips, NOTHING. Also the airlines should tell you that nothing is opened when they are telling you they aren‚Äôt providing hotels because the issue was weather related.",1
Airport,"Airport is very busy, too big, and some staff members were just down right RUDE!!! I will never fly out of this airport again.",1
Airport,"The hoops I went through. I understand cancelations happen. But, when you refuse to regularly communicate, along with Delta, people start screaming.",1
Airport,The TSA is one of the worst I‚Äôve seen. Simply rude without reasoning.,1
Airport,Bags take way too long to get from baggage claim,1
Airport,"Told to arrive 2 hours before 5:30am flight which I did. Ticket counter did not open until 4:15am. The Delta staff at counter talked with each other before opening counter. The line was so long to check bag, then security was worse. Made it to my flight with 2 mins to spare. Very stressful.",1
Airport,All the food places closed early and or ran out of food.  I was in line to get a cold sandwich they closed the door in my face saying they out when I could clearly see they had a bunch left.,1
Airport,"This trip was a complete disaster. They knew since noon that there were weather delays and that it would cause problems with connecting flights, and yet the airline ran out of hotels for people to stay at, and the USO was closed. I understand having normal operating hours, but I feel really let down that they couldn't have made special arrangements to take care of displaced veterans",1
Airport,This Airport is so incompetent. RUDE EMPLOYEES! Inexperienced baggage people! A total Train Wreck !!!,1
Airport,"Horrible.... missed flights coming through for a connecting flight 5 days later missed another flight going back and had to  stay overnight to fly in the morning. No help with wheelchair they gave my mother's away, which was registered for the flight!",1
Airport,Very difficult airport to navigate your way around especially if it is your first time.,1
Airport,"Put down a one star, only because,  once our plane landed,  3 hr layover from Atlanta to Greenville  !!!! Why !!! Could have rented a car and driven home.  Flight was with Delta,  just don't get it.  Airport it self was very good.",1
Airport,To confusing! Too many Trams to catch to get to your Departure location.,1
Airport,"Been out of the country for 3 weeks. Amsterdam.  Latvia. most wonderful  kind experience . Sweet intelligent  people . We land here to uneducated , no common sense  people. TSA is rude on a power trip. The hatred for white people and chip on their shoulder is unbelievable.
The mixed culture  of europe isso beautiful, you don't  hear racism or prejudice comments",1

Airport,"When entering, TSA very slow. When arrive, ramp comes late every time! Go to LAX how to run!",1
Airport,"This Airport is a joke. To small for the population and Tourist Travel. Gates are overcrowded can't find a seat. I had to wait in concessions area.
SAN ANTONIO needs build a New International Airport out by hwy 1604. ‚úàÔ∏è",1
Airport,"Dirty , food on the seating, definitely not sanitized.",1
Airport,Worst airport I ever traveler through. 4 people working the customs for US citizens with hundred passengers waiting on the connections line. The connection was on the complete opposite side of the airport. Just made my flight because I ran and luckily was able to figure it out quickly.,1
Airport,Every restaurant/store closes at 9pm.    Very disappointed,1
Airport,All of the restaurants and snack areas close between 8-9. The ones that stay open later were only selling liquor. People who have later flights should be able to grab something to eat.,1
Airport,"Bald, short, male TSA agent at terminal 2 was on a real power trip. Bossing people around with condescending tone. Absolutely disrespectful and hostile. Fortunately he is clearly not qualified for a real law enforcement job, otherwise he will be terrorizing even more people under his unstable temper.",1
Airport,This airport has no idea at all. They are the worst. The  entire place probably can't read. Dumb! Do better!,1
Airport,Airport restaurant listing not up.to date. Needs to be.updated.,1
Airport,"Five 5 passport controls for hundreds of people and some who could afford to, let others ahead to catch their flight. 3 hour wait. Avoid ATL!",1
Airport,"Not a good experience!!!  Very hard to navigate due to changing signs.  Extremely hot in the airport, majority of people sweating today. No air conditioning.  Not happy",1
Airport,"SOUTH WEST AIRLINES from Denver to Atlanta, had little regard for handicapped  wheelchair customers. Over 12 of us had to wait 2 HOURS for assistance to get to our luggage area where family was waiting. Arrived at 9:30 pm. Left airport at 12:38 pm. Shameful!",1
Airport,Staff leave handicapped passengers at the gates for hours after landing. No people to push the passengers to baggage. My mom was extremely thirsty and tired when they brought her out two hours after landing!! DISGUSTING and ABUSIVE!!,1
Airport,Run more than one shuttle from international to domestic terminal this sucks!,1
Airport,TSA Pre is pointless at terminal b. They let the CLEAR people go ahead of you and those people back up the screening process. It took me 15 minutes to get through PRE. Line for non-PRE took five minutes.,1
Airport,"food service places have closed early.  Wendy's, Popeyes, Asian chao all closed in term b.li es for few open places are crazy long.  Boo!!",1
Airport,Lines were way too long and did not move fast,1
Airport,"No parking, flight got changed and we drove around the parking lot for over an hour looking for a spot. Got to terminal to find out our flight couldn't be found and no one was helpful.",1
Airport,"I can't believe cleaners' contractors are paid minimum pay at this massive, multimillion-dollar airport. I'm not sure whether you've visited the airport, but it's one of the country's largest. According to the news, the hourly wage will increase from $8.50 to $12. The saddest part of the news piece is seeing African Americans get by with just enough money to live comfortably.",1
Airport,On of those airports you want to avoid at all costs,1
Airport,1hr+ WAIT for your baggage is TOO LONG!! I fly AMERICAN (First Class) EVERY WEEK!!!! There is no reason for priority MARKED Bags to come down LAST! There's NO REASON for the bags to take 1hour plus to come down!!! American Airlines and Atlanta Hartsfield need to DO BETTER! I'm SICK of the LACK SERVICE!!!,1
Airport,They couldn't even figure out how to move luggage from our connecting flights. Now my wife has no clothes or any belongings.,1
Airport,"Don't try to go through security between 4:00am and 4:40! The entire airport is confused by which TSA checkpoint is open and which one is closed. They have great food in the terminal. If you get the time, visit the rainforest under the airport! 3 stars.",1
Airport,"Queue an hour for homeland, then go and queue another hour just for the bus to go to car rentals. Aweful",1
Airport,"Worst airport ever. Spring break, canceled and/or delayed flights, and long lines. All the while, staff stood around talking.",1
Airport,Seats are very uncomfortable... never knew that till I had to sleep on them because of flight delays,1

Airport,I hate airports it's always a problem at this airport always. Don't matter if you early or late.,1

Airport,No help  with anything from baggage claim to check in,1
Airport,Too big. I was sent to 4 different terminals. Rude service people.,1
Airport,B Concourse was very hot-I don't know what the problem was. Restrooms were cooler than the gate areas!,1
Airport,A quarter of the check-in kiosks were out of order. ¬†One of two escalators was broken. ¬†None of the power outlets at our gate (A17) worked. ¬†I hope the aircraft maintenance is better. ¬†The worst will be when we return. ¬†SMF has the slowest baggage handling I've ever experienced. ¬†Lol. ¬†They just announced baggage carousel #1 is broken.,1
Airport,Employees are rude and cant check in to internet,1
Airport,"Huge airport - 6-7 terminals. Tons of people and places. And staff is strict and unpleasant - not helping, not understanding. D terminal is small and crumbled, no space for people.  Tha A terminal is spacious and new. Plus Delta planes are always late or rescheduled.",1
Airport,"There was no long term parking available. I was forced to park in the hourly lot...for 10 days.
Inadequate infrastructure.",1
Airport,To big of an airport to get rid of smoking areas.,1
Airport,"How does anyone give this horrible airport a good review? People who work here from checkin, to TSA, to shops are ridiculously rude from top to bottom. I dont need you to kiss my behind, just dont be one.",1
Airport,Horrible!!!!! The construction was unorganized.  The rerouting was rediculious. Then my flight got delayed 1hr and 30 minutes. It was just a MESS. Got to Portland bags were on another fight. Had to go home then come back to get my bags. I was disgusted,1
Airport,If you‚Äôre flight is after 9pm there are zero restaurants and bars open here.  Ridiculous,1
Airport,"They're too strict, with the people they shouldn't be hate it.",1
Airport,"If you fly in at 930pm, be prepared for absolutely nothing being open for food, no sandwich vending machines, nothing... Dinner was a overpriced monster and pretzels out of the 1 working vending machine.
I pray I don't have to fly through this airport again",1
Airport,"Horrid layout. The ideas of having to travel underground and catch a light rail to get to the next terminal almost guarantees being late for your connecting flight. Especially when there constantly changing the gate to flights. Also, half the staff acts as if they can not be bothered to help you. If you need it.",1
Airport,"Dirty, but masks are on the way out! A good percentage of TSA and staff were ok not wearing them finally. Walked straight through until the plane!",1
Airport,So I found out the hard way that international flights are in the domestic terminal. It takes forever to get shuttles to and fro. There are no straight streets so transportation takes forever. Worst terminal this country has to offer.,1
Airport,"They treat international passengers as criminals, they would not allow my cousin to use his phone at the time. If you aren‚Äôt going to have Spanish speakers on hand then let them have access to someone who can translate and help them. I would have given 0 stars if possible. They are incredibly inefficient we had been waiting for a total of 3 hours.",1
Airport,"Terminal E all real restaurants are closed. The food court is a joke, 30-40 minute waits. Open the restaurants!!!!",1
Airport,Welcome to the Atlanta airport! You are now trapped.. The food is terrible and the drinks are triple-priced. And the service is the worst ever. Enjoy...,1
Airport,Seriously?  Landed before 7PM on a Saturday and 90% of EVERYTHING IN THIS AIRPORT IS CLOSED...????!!!,1
Airport,Arrived International flight from Korea.  Make it down to immigration.  Only 2 desks open.  Really....people have connecting flights.  Took 40 minutes to get through.  Nobody else came to man the 15+ unmanned desks.  This is why I despise flying through Atlanta from overseas assignments.  I'd rather fly through JFK and we know how bad that place is!!!!!!,1
Airport,Airport is very HOT!!! Too many people not to have air conditioning going at a comfortable temp.  Most trash canisters are overflowing,1
Airport,Lying agents and airport administration. Needs to get dealt with. Corruption at the highest levels in the city‚Äôs history.,1
Airport,"Airport is big and sort of clean. TSA employees lack of training and customer service. They treat people like people are asking for favors. If TSA employees in Atlanta are miserable doing their job, maybe they should find something else where they can useful and not disrespect people.",1
Airport,Filthy dirty. ¬† No restaurants open anywhere at 8:30P. ¬†D terminal smells like a sewer. ¬†Will try to connect through alternative airports in the future.,1
Airport,Horrible airport they need more bigger ppl in charge and no wait y'all let all these ppl give ¬†you an excuse to jump the line rule don't separate from ur kid Especially when the kids looks 23 with grown baby hairs ...then the train doesn't open on the 1st two gates ...get a system because organized chaos isn't it,1
Airport,"This airport is PURE CHAOS. Not only was EVERY BATHROOM closed, the priority/first class constituents were asked to and then sent to another part of the airport just to wait longer. We were there hours before our flight and came close the end of boarding. RIDICULOUS.",1
AZM,And for some reason this ride was closed as well I don‚Äôt know why some other ride were closed today hopefully some of them will be open next weekend,1

Airport,"TSA is terrible and treats everyone with complete contempt.
Don‚Äôt fly through here unless you want your items destroyed and your trip ruined.

Not even sure why TSA employees are employed when they obviously hate their jobs.",1
Aquarium,The Mini Melts machines didn‚Äôt work. They had 3 of them and all of them were out of order. They need to service their equipment better.,1
Aquarium,"15 to 20 min wait at every display , grown people standing infront of every display texting and talking keeping kids from actually seeing anything",1
Airport,The workers here go out of their way to be as rude as they can be. It‚Äôs uncalled for especially when the place is so big that people are just trying to figure out where they are going to not miss their flights.,1
Museum,I live local and my daughter wanted her birthday to be a wonderworks. I was appalled by the employee Terrell who works on the rope course. His rude and lazy way of dealing with people  should be looked into. Will Not be returning to wonderworks again,1

Theme Park,"Waited on line for 25 minutes to find out my kids were too small. The sign was not outside the line but at the gate when you walk in.

Theme Park,Don't waste your money on the annualpass its a scam !!! they never have availability..... have had the pass for almost 1 year and could not book even a single trip,1
Airport,"It was too crowded!! There was definitely not respect for ""safe distance 6ft"" no kind of organization!! The restrooms were nasty and dirty, the whole place smelled.

Airport,I had to drive in from Tennessee but that's not the issue the issue is the confusing system to pick up people frome the air port im only go back if I fly delta,1
Airport,SkyTrain smells like a dirty bathroom.,1
Airport,I know this isn't entirely the airports fault. I'm just wondering how such an airline like Viva Aerobus is even allowed to operate out of San Antonio Airport. There should be a level of accountability for all airlines that operate out of this airport. I have NEVER had an experience like this in my 30 years of life and it does reflect poorly on the entire airport itself.,1
Theme Park,Park is designed to maximize profit over customer experience. So many design flaws. Unjustifiably expensive. The way finding is terrible; Ikea has better signage. They are a long way from a Disney-type experience.,1

Zoo,"Today, Saturday May 30, 2022. All we saw was mostly dirt and perceived a lot of bad smells. According to the zoo they were protecting birds from the bird flu. No explanation about the other animals. What a rip off!",1

Theme Park,Cute for little kids but super dirty. I won't go back.,1
Zoo,"A waste of time and money , no animals to see and was dirty I brought family from out of town and we all were very disappointed",1
Zoo,Wouldn't give a refund and hung up on me for asking. Girl on the phone was really rude.,1
Museum,Me and my group came the lady had on toe out sandles and they let her ride ....It seemed evident that the African American group didn't have the same rules! I'm very disappointed at the racism we experienced from the register to the back!,1
Theme Park,"$58 for ( preferred parking ) No belt no metal at all but the rims on my glasses.  The kid told me to empty my pockets 3 times .  $16 for a glass to refill for $2
Needless to say it will probably be another 10 years before I go back .",1
Theme Park,My number one complaint is I feel sorry for the animals..Their enclosures are small..And they are not well taken care of everybody should boycott this whole theme park because of that..,1
Airport,Way too complicated for those that don't fly on a regular basis. We got off 1 plane there and had to run like hell to get on our next plane. Place is extremely huge and always packed with tons of people.,1
Garden,My wife and I were very excited to see Tulip flowers. But we were very disappointed as the area was closed for some private events.,1
Airport,Most fast food paces in the Domestic terminal close at 7pm!!! Ghost town after 7 with limited options.,1
Airport,If you land at 9:30PM FORGET ABOUT FOO OR DRINKD. EVERYTHING CLOSES. It's pathetic for supposedly the busiest airport in the United States you can't get anything to eat or drink.,1
Airport,What an armpit of an airport. The Biden and local Democrat administration's should be ashamed. ¬† They don't even make an attempt to serve ANYBODY! ¬†WHAT AN EMBARRASMENT TO THE CITY AND STATE!!,1
Theme Park,Legoland should be ashamed. They change Active Duty Military getting in for free and don't publish it anywhere. I show up with my ID after buying 9 tickets from the MWR 2 days earlier. Because they didn't put that information out I had to pay 30 dollars more. Manager ran away. Disgusting. 0 stars.,1
Aquarium,Food is hella pricey. Make sure you eat elsewhere beforehand,1
Aquarium,"waste of money
waste of money $40 per person, not worth  spending, for 3 people $122 total. need refund. Nothing great here.",1
Zoo,"Police was dirty unkept very few animals out greatly

disappointed",1
Airport,jetblue tsa stole sneakers and bags out of my luggage,1
AZM,It was a very hot day they advertised alot of animals but none were there we paid almost 83 dollars to see like 6 exhibits,1
Museum,"Go early or late to avoid school groups
The museum was beautiful but our experience was less than ideal by out of control school kids running wild, screaming, throwing things with little or no supervision. I know I sound like a curmudgeon but it ruined the experience.",1
Airport,The rudeness in security is absolutely absurd. I travel for work and cringe when I have to go to Atlanta. You are talked to like your an idiot. The rudeness airport security ever and I fly into a-lot of different airport weekly. The women being the worst. It‚Äôs like they enjoy talking down to people. If it was for US y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt have a job. Fact!,1
Airport,Security check took almost an hour at 5.00 am.,1
Museum,"After visiting this museum, you wish the Soviets had won the race to the moon. More than disappointing.",1
Airport,The map on the website was useless.,1
AZM,"It was bad that I went on a holiday, but ... All the tickets on the day were sold out ... I&#39;m sorry that my child from Okinawa wanted to see the Lego exhibition, but I was really disappointed. It was even more disappointing because the response was cold ...",1
Theme Park,"If you are going to force visitors to Pre purchase tickets days ahead online - DO NOT make it non refundable or incredibly difficult to reschedule due to rain!
No email contact and nobody picks up the phone.",1
Museum,Could of done more and added more attractions then what they have especially if the vr experience is going to be sold out most of the time,1
Theme Park,"If only the rides weren't mostly closed today....totally frustrating to buy season passes, load up the grandkids,  drive three hours to get here...what is the deal, SDC?  Not to mention perfect temperatures to be here...and no rain!  Frustrating!",1
Theme Park,"The place is clean and fun, and I hope this is a one off, but out of the few rides they have everyone of them broke down, we spent the day in lines, and being told they were broken, 40 minutes of waiting then broken, over and over 4 rides in one day.",1
Zoo,"the place is quite dirty and disorganized. The signs are pretty bad.
The environment of the animals is quite worn and dirty.
They make a lot of money but I think they don't invest it in keeping the place in top condition.",1
Theme Park,Sold tickets that are useless to me because of not being able to ride anything.,1
Theme Park,For the price of everything just to get in the park just for practically everything to be closed is ridiculous. Almost $40 to play mini golf and ride a ten minute train ride. Very disappointed,1
Zoo,Over half the exhibits were not even open. No polar bears no tiger no elephants. Disappointed,1
Theme Park,Poorly managed. Food choices for all inclusive packages stink. Definitely not worth the money. Come visit leave don't stay,1
Theme Park,Tourist Trap overpriced ripoff Dolly can't afford to come to her own park. It's to expensive.,1
Airport,"I really hate going here...
Update:
I still hate going here!",1
Attraction,What a waste of money! ¬†The children look board. ¬† Let alone the sorry parents. ¬† 250$ ¬†for nothing.,1
AZM,Paid $24 to get in and many of the exhibits we're closed. And who collects for parking on the way out? A disappointing day and then you have to wait in line to leave.,1
Airport,Traffic was a nightmare for drop off and pick up.,1
Airport,Both domestic terminal car parks closed. No alerts before arriving. Very poor directions to alternatives.,1
Aquarium,Very disappointed way overpriced and not alot to see staff not very friendly or helpful,1
Garden,"It used to be my favorite place but all historical buildings were closed when I visited last week. There were not enough flowers, but probably because it's still May. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the money.",1
Museum,"In a recent interview with trade magazine ‚ÄòInside Paper‚Äô I was asked ‚Äòwhat my biggest disappointment‚Äô was. I took little time to respond; ‚ÄòAlton Towers‚Äô.

Sadly today I visited The Houston Space Center and have had reevaluate the above statement. It‚Äôs rubbish. Next‚Ä¶",1
Airport,"Wow
Came through airport last week at 8am and most shops and food not open. Came through tonight at 9.15 and all shops closed and food vendors in process of closing. Couldn't even find a bottle of water on C.
World's busiest airport-what a black eye on Atlanta . Then thee mayor comes on PA system to welcome us to the airport and Atlanta.
Very disappointing  .",1
Theme Park,Not a single beer or drink to be found at this place very unusual  for a park.,1
Airport,I was double charged for parking. Now too much hassle to get $10 back. Need to improve machine performance .,1
Zoo,Had timed entry tickets but spent 30 minutes trying to find a parking place. Gave up and went home  unable to get 5 tickets refunded. Very disappointing üòï,1
Airport,I do not understand if this airport is known for how busy it is how TSA Pre could take almost an hour. ¬†They were rude and they basically told me that my daughter is not a person. ¬† Horrible experience.,1
AZM,"There is no place to play, there are only two places for building blocks, two small mobile games, a dynamic cinema, and a miniature of Hong Kong.",1
Attraction,"Bad customer service
You guys need more options to eat lunch all the pizza foods were closed, bad customer service and we will not be returning",1
Airport,Disappointed there wasn‚Äôt any lounge available for folks who are on red eye flights going east.,1
Airport,Worst airport I've been at. I had a 1lt bottle of alcohol bagged in a sealed airport bag in Greece. At the Atl airport I wad told to do a check bag by tsa. My wife had to do the same. Went back through security only to see another person allowed to pass with the same bottle I had in an exact same bag. BS...,1
Museum,"Very unimpressed,  disappointed  a little, seems like nothing changed in the past 20 years!!!",1
Aquarium,50 Dollars and they close everything earlier than it says online?! No recommended. Also animals are having to small space.,1
Theme Park,Dont waste your money. Overpriced. Kind of sucks. Weird ride height requirements. Rude staff.,1
Airport,"no place to eat, restaurants are closed or close by 8pm leaving 10s of thousands of travelers no place to eat. Charlotte and Houston for me now on.",1
Airport,"At 9 pm, everything shuts down food wise. Being stuck at the airport with constant delayed flights, two very young children and nothing to feed or give them to drink, it‚Äôs horrible.",1
Airport,"Absolute mess of an airport. For domestic flights, departing, plan for a minimum of 3 hours to make it to your flight. Security wait times are not accurate online, I'd add an extra 30-60 mins to what is shown on the website. I was directed to the wrong checkpoint after waiting 30 mins which caused me to miss my flight. I will never be flying out of Atlanta again.",1
Airport,Too big w no escalators to move fast,1
AZM,All the elephants have to crowd under one of the shades in their enclosure the other one does not have a shade cover it is off you would think with all the money they get from admission that they could fix this,1
Theme Park,"Paid full price to be told we have to leave early because of a private event. We will never return.. not as fun as it was when I was a kid.. now I know why they call it "" steal your dollar city """,1
Airport,"Tramway got stuck to plane, missed connecting flight at next airport.",1
Airport,"The entire international terminal's arrivals and departures have only one parking deck.
It's as if the international terminal was an afterthought after making the domestic terminal. Horrible experience every time.",1
Theme Park,Too high price on anything & everything. Service is worst. Total waste of time and money. Should think twice or more before going in there.,1
AZM,How depressing... They destroyed an invaluable prehistoric site full of ancient ruins for a plastic toy theme park. What the politicians and business people behind this project did is truly despicable.,1

AZM,"I didn&#39;t pay my own money, so I just went, but if you tell me to pay the expensive entrance fee to go, I won&#39;t go. Make sure to eat rice. Expensive and tasteless. If there are a lot of people, you have to wait in a line to eat.",1
AZM,"The restaurant is a waste of the steamed money, tasteless hamburger buns are given away.",1
AZM,"There are not many rides, and you have to wait in a long line. There are not many food stalls, so you have to stand in a lot of lines, and there are not many tables... Good for heat stroke on a hot day because there is no shade.",1
AZM,Too poor for the price due to the bombing of parking fees... Very disappointing,1
AZM,Worst resort where you have to stand in line for more than 30 minutes to buy food.,1

AZM,"Is it really right to build without the ruins of prehistoric times? If China continues to carry out the Northeast Project in the absence of a place that can be the beginning of Gojoseon based only on money, we have no choice but to keep our mouths shut. ? The history of Gojoseon was erased.",1
Airport,most ghetto airport on the planet on the on site parking and they just aren't ready for customer service.,1
Theme Park,Felt totally ripped off. The resteraunts stunk. The park was totally blase'. The watermark stunk. Hotel room you guessed it stunk. All an all a waste of money for a family of 5. Go to universal. Better money spent there,1
Airport,This is one of the worst designs for an airport I've ever come across. You have to take at least 2 elevators unless your lucky enough to get ground floor parking. Then the escalators are broken about 1/2 the time and the food selections in terminal B are almost nil. If there was another choice I'd take it.,1
Theme Park,I drove 5 hours with my teen kids spent all that money on tickets just to leave 2 hours later.. So boring nothing there for kids over 9!! Rides if u can even call them that So Lame my kids where crying how pathetic it was.,1
Airport,My experience was awful! I waited for my bags for 45 minutes which caused me to miss my ride!!!ü§¨ü§¨,1
Airport,Rude agents. Confusing airport.,1
Airport,Boarding agent yells ‚ÄúIf you have a boarding pass get in line!!!‚Äù  No organization and honestly dangerous!!! This flight was absolute chaos both ATL and frontier did nothing to help. ATL had no wheelchairs and frontier was letting handicapped passengers get trampled as they couldn‚Äôt even get wheelchairs. Probably the worst airport in the country.,1
AZM,"It&#39;s a place worth seeing if you have to spend 5,000 won per person and 5,000 won for a balloon. I got a parking fee of 18,000 won and there was nothing to ride on and I didn&#39;t even use the equipment.",1
AZM,"When buying a ticket you have to show your passport, then I had to pay 30 euros more than my Thai companion, pure xenophobia. Please don&#39;t support such nonsense, the experience was nice, lots of animals and fish. Foreigners are treated unfairly, better avoid",1

THIS PLACE WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT NO ANIMALS WERE OUT ANYWHERE ONE RESTAURANT/ FOOD TRUCK WAS OPEN  OUT OF ALL OF THEM THIS PLACE IS NOTHING BUT UPHILL EVERYWHERE AND NO SORT OF DIRECTION  AT ALL PLACE WAS DESIGNED SO TERRIBLE .",1
Theme Park,I purchased season passes and they‚Äôre closed 2-3 days out of the week and open just on the weekend. This is ridiculous!! I feel like they‚Äôre scamming people out of their money!,1
AZM,There is almost no shade from trees.. I recommend going to Everland or Seoul Land for an experience at an expensive price ^^,1
Airport,"It is so bad, it‚Äôs pathetic. Very few food store open with a very long line. The airport is dirty and chaotic. Pilots and flight attendant wait forever to get serve. It is a disgrace. I recently came back from Europe and we need to change our ways. Atlanta is one of the biggest airports and going downhill for services.",1
AZM,"It took us 55 minutes to complete the whole aquarium... thats 2 adults and 2 young kids...
Ridiculously high priced for less than an 1 hours worth of visit... for 4 of us, cost almost $150 usd...
Wish i knew that before going in...",1
Theme Park,$25 for standard parking is insulting. We will go elsewhere!!!,1
Airport,"So dirty! Ants all over the sticky seats, we couldn‚Äôt  even sit down. The windows are dirty also, CLEAN TF UP!!!!",1
AZM,All animals were sleep half the exhibits was closed ... Got charged  for parking and it was free for that day,1
Airport,"NO PARKING! Hourly lot - FULL. Daily lot - FULL.  Garage - FULL. Middle of the day on a Wednesday, and international flying has still not recovered from the pandemic, so this is just going to get worse. If you are planning to park at this airport, you should probably make alternate plans! Massive fail.",1
Theme Park,Got there 11 ammo parking in any parking lot. No handicapped parking. Very upset they destroyed the old handicapped parking putting a tram stop there! We had to go home! No handicapped parking!!!!!,1
Theme Park,Overpriced and too many people. Could only ride 3 rides because of the lines. This was probably my 10th time at Dollywood and I will never return.,1
Airport,"Been to a lot of airports, The baggage checkers here are extremely self important losers",1
Zoo,$50 for 2 adults and not where to get food. Everywhere was closed. Not worth the money.,1
Airport,What a dreary airport. Reminded me of SMF before the upgrade 20 years ago. On par with the St Louis Airport which is close to the bottom of my list. I was surprised since all I hear is how big everything is in Texas....to top it off they don't even have a lounge for Amex/Priority Pass Members. (Yes I know 1st world problems.) C'mon Man get it together!,1
AZM,"I was issued a driver&#39;s license, but the price wasn&#39;t written on it, but now I don&#39;t know if it was written. I gave 25,000 won per person.",1

Airport,Literally the dumbest people in Ga got together to create this disorganized airport,1
AZM,Half the animals were not out...not a zoo for a disabled person to enjoy...,1
AZM,Recommended for preschoolers Parking fee 18000 Expensive There are not many kinds of food and the taste is not good,1
Theme Park,Drove 2 hours to get here and found out I can't use my bring a friend with the pass on fridays...they won't make any exceptions,1
Theme Park,the roller coasters were so hard to find they were all slow and boring and it stinks,1
Airport,Undoubtedly the worst airport I have been to. Understaffed at check in. 1 staff at the bar in international so took 45 minutes to get served. Staff really don't seem to care. Not recommended at all,1
Airport,"8am, sat. Nothing to eat or drink. Vending machines just eat money and no product",1
Airport,"0 stars, worst airport ever, stay away if possible",1
Aquarium,"This place used to be wonderful - now with show reservations, it is horrible to bring toddlers to. Such a disappointment.

If they at least attempted to accommodate with a standby line, I would be a lot happier. There‚Äôs so many empty seats but without the reservation, they don‚Äôt let you in.",1
AZM,It says hurricane bay is open but it isn't. And they're still charging for both parks. Ridiculous. Also I paid 10$ to park and ended up leaving after 5 mins because hurricane bay was closed and the lady wouldn't give me a refund.,1
Airport,Employees are all incompetent and cannot even provide simple instructions,1
Theme Park,Horrible. No shade. Very small. Hotel does not have a pool open even though it was advertised. No refunds too never coming back again.,1
Theme Park,To many people of color HATEN people of the opposite color and it's all a bunch of B.S .Scared for MY WIFE SAFETY about B.S. and wasn't worth the time...,1
AZM,"If you have been to at least one oceanarium, it makes no sense to go far. Especially considering that the ticket price is 1300 baht for an adult and 1200 for a child. Total 5 thousand in 40 minutes.",1
AZM,"You have to pay 18,000 won for parking for no reason... The facility is not yet complete, the overall operation is not complete, the system has stopped working, and the scale is not large.",1
Airport,Filthy where you sit at... trash every where..on the floors,1
Aquarium,3 And a half hour wait didn't even get to see the penguins,1
Airport,Every time I fly here the boarding is late.   Dirty and bad customer service,1
Airport,Worse airport ever make ppl missed flight change gates without knowing. I Will not recommended anyone to travel to this airport.,1
Airport,There's nothing but confusion and unhelpful employees. First time flying and the experience here made it my last time flying.,1
Airport,"Daily($16)parking lot was full! Employe who was working the area told us to just park in hourly($36 for 24hrs)and we‚Äôll be charged for daily. We flew to LA for Thursday came back Sunday. Instead of getting the daily rate what she told us we was getting because daily was full, we had to pay hourly which ends up being $144!!! Should‚Äôve been $64!",1
Attraction,"Super expensive, and very long lines, they have staff shortage but still charge public a ton, does not worth the price",1
Theme Park,So bad waiting for 40 minutes working mistake for the key to play pay the money for sunny,1
Airport,This airport s u c k s !!! They make everything so difficult and  the restaurant works are slow and incompetent ! How tf u gonna close tsa pre check ???  We pay to have that smh !,1
Aquarium,"This is a prison for fish! Ask the aquarium how far distance each fish is coordinated in nature to move everyday, then ask how big their prison cell is. This spoon feeding animal cruelty to children, could only foster them to be cruel to animals and then to humans. Thank you very much.",1
Airport,TSA should learn what a zipper is because that's what makes a line on the screen. I also enjoy not stopping any other males for their zipper or the guy after me for the same thing.,1
Airport,"It's a chaotic, poorly organized mess.  The worst place to reenter the US.  I've done that rice now but will never do so again.",1
Zoo,This to me is a zoo that makes me wonder why we have zoos anymore. Zoos are places to see animals and bring back wonder in our lives. This is a very dinky zoo with not much attractions. Point Defiance is designed to take a Karen and her toddler through in less than an hour.,1
Airport,"Poor selection in F concourse of food. Food is very expensive, poor quality, tiny and the service is poor. Food/drink shops have no pricing ok anything. If this isn't illegal, it should be. I'm sure the reason is that the prices are through the roof.
Beer at a bar was $12.99! Crazy!  I will avoid ATL in the future!",1
Theme Park,"LEGOLAND Florida - Only 1 EV charging station for thousands of vehicles that drive to your park every day, SHAME ON YOU!  Do better",1

Airport,Worst airport. Waited over an hour to take shuttle from the international terminal to their domestic terminal.,1
Airport,Returned at  ~ midnight and all the gate waiting areas had trash under and around the seats. Seemed everywhere. I left a nice clean airport to return to a dirty one.,1
AZM,"It&#39;s smaller than I thought and the 4D movies aren&#39;t that good (the running time of the movie is too short), and you can watch it for about 30 minutes at the earliest.",1
Airport,Baggage nighttime manager is lazy and refuses to do his job. Communication between branches is null and  the disrespect was uncanny. I will never be flying into Atlanta again,1
AZM,The food places like to close super early. They was RUDE.,1
Theme Park,Why go if you have to make a reservation.  Used to you could just show up and have fun but not anymore.,1
Theme Park,$84 for general admission (party of 6). Waiting inline for an hr and a half for rides. Or you can spend another $80 per and get the pass to just walk on the rides. In my opinion theres a much better use to that money around town than wasting it here,1
Theme Park,"There were many shows not playing.  Wait times for food and rides were very long.   Also, be prepared to wait at least an hour for parking and  tram ride to the entrance.  I get that businesses everywhere are under staffed but then lower the prices to accommodate your patrons.",1
Airport,"I can report wheelchair assistance for persons with disabilities is ok - except for Spirit Airlines - which on 5/26/2022 totally failed to provide reserved assistance.

I want to thank Officer Coleman, a TSA agent at the Main Checkpoint , and his team!  They made sure I safely got to the plane.",1
Museum,"I felt that NASA's rationale for the program and the large spend was weak. Additionally, at this point, it seemed like astronauts cared more about going to space and the view than making a change in the world.",1
Airport,Very crowded but they did their best to keep people moving through the airport.  Gate agent kept us updated on the 45 minute delay.,1
Airport,TSA agents are really rude (even in comparison to EWR) and the infrastructure around the terminal is old,1
Attraction,They need to repaint and fix the 20 attractions that don't work,1
Museum,"So sad, hardly a dang thing worth going to here anymore. They've really outdone themselves with having the fewest exhibits possible. Such a waste of time and space. I used to love this place. üòì Very disappointing. üíî",1
Airport,"It's always hot in the terminals, like the air is broken, feels like a breeding ground for germs.",1
AZM,"Too expensive for the facilities. I go to use the facility, but the parking fee of 18,000 won is severe. I felt like I was looking at the parents who had no choice but to go because of their children.",1
Attraction,"Dissatisfied in food options.
It was frustrating that a lot of the food vendors were closed and there wasn‚Äôt a lot of options to eat from. We stayed at the hotel and it was the sameThere. We had nowhere to buy food fromBetweeen 10:30-11. Which is prime timeBefore heading Into the park.",1
Airport,The worst ever experienced. Wheel chair service agent never showed up. Agents from other airlines very rude. Officers at immigration on the other hand were the best.,1
Airport,"Thee worst. This was my 1st time  to Atlanta, I spent 2 hours in a line to check my bags almost lose my flight. Delta Agents sending people to the wrong line.",1

AZM,I‚Äôve been to many zoos throughout the Southeast and by far this was the worse. The Zoo can‚Äôt decide if it‚Äôs a theme park or a Zoo very few animals and very confusing maps. Only reason I enjoyed it was for the manatees.,1
Aquarium,Terrible experience was scheduled at 8pm they kicked us out in under 45 minutes half the tanks were closed we saw less than a quarter of the aquarium before they aggressively made us leave. Fish we did see looked well taken care of.,1
Attraction,Everything is overpriced and if you buy a refillable you are only allowed to we feel like every 10 minutes this place really takes advantage of families,1
Attraction,Charged me to park. Plus several other annoying things.,1
Theme Park,It's so expensive now to go It's not for  poor people and that's a shame since Dolly  started out poor. It's  $215 plus  taxes for a gold pass which saves on parking costs and other costs. It's $25 dollars to park your car there. It's ridiculously expensive and that's a shame. Very disappointing,1
Museum,Not much of a science center. Would not waste the money.,1
Museum,We drive 5 hours to Space Venter Houston. When we bought tickets no one tell us all evens reservations is full. So we spent 65 dolls and can‚Äôt play anything. I want give 0 start,1
Airport,Catch 2 stars because everything is closed at 8pm - including CLEAR.,1
Theme Park,The duplo splash pad is filthy and over half of the nozzles aren't working. Pieces of floor are all torn up. Service the area or close it off,1
Airport,Absolutely hideous.  Not enough parking. Signs don't match lanes. Parking was full but sign said open. Sat in traffic for hours.  Not acceptable for busiest airport.,1

Theme Park,I can‚Äôt believe i spent so much money for my family to come and all we got on was 1 ride. For the rest of the rides i waited on an 1hr line for them to then close it. Im so upset! Never again please don‚Äôt go here!,1
Attraction,"I can barely understand paying almost $100/person, but to have most of the rides and concessions closed 1hr before closing is unacceptable.",1

Museum,"Really disappointing. Incredibly crowded, poorly organized, their app for booking tram rides straight-up doesn't work. Three staff members couldn't even tell you how long a tram ride was supposed to be. Really disappointed.",1
Airport,Why does every food establishment in this place close at 9pm? Even the quick marts? Nothing about that is acceptable with this being a HUGE airport hub for connecting flights. 9pm is incredibly early with how busy this airport is at and after 9pm. Figure something out.,1
AZM,Do not recommend if you have any autistic children over the age of five.,1
Museum,"Crowded, poorly organized
Incredibly crowded, poorly organized. The app for booking trams is hot trash. Was really disappointed.",1
AZM,"No outside food allowed, parking fee is very low... No difference from general amusement parks",1
Aquarium,This place is horrible for parking. Even Entering and exiting the park is beyond pathetic you‚Äôd think they would fix this garbage for the amount of money they charge.  People have babies in there car!!!,1
Aquarium,"did not appreciate the super expensive food they had, tourist trap, gouging everyone",1
Aquarium,Genuinely the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced in my life. The cashier was entirely too old not to know how to ring someone up. Is rudeness part of the training here or is it something that comes naturally?,1
Aquarium,very mediocre. üò¨ not enough to see for the money you pay. hyped in my opinion. was bored after 13 minutes.,1
Aquarium,It was super hyped as a tourist destination but it was a bit less grandiose than the photos online make it seem. The octopus was completely hidden in a giant tank which made no sense. The jellyfish exhibit was much smaller than it seemed online.,1
Theme Park,"Terrible at accommodating amputees! As a quad, I could do a grand total of 2 rides - the carousel and the train. Many other parks have let me enjoy the rides, but this is a huge exception. I would never recommend this park anyone with a disability.",1
Airport,Super expensive stores and restaurants.  Pretty rude staff around the airport.,1
Museum,"The models are old and looks like they are starting to melt, its expensive and to just look at wax people. We didn't go all the way thru cause my grandchildren thought it was dumb. We live close but in my opinion ""save your money """,1
Airport,"First of all this airline personnel are useless. When a young person asks for help finding where to go and noone helps, you are rude. Do not recommend if you need help at this airport, they don't care",1
Airport,"Walking in the airport, a robot garbage ran into me causing me to fall.  I also had bruises on my hand and cheek.  I suggest those robots be removed.  I have contacted my lawyer concerning this situation.",1
AZM,"Why closed on Wednesday, June 1. Makes no sense! Drove all the way here! This is upsetting! During Pride Month too‚Ä¶ Wow just wow!",1
Museum,The whole point of visiting are the tours. We get there after driving 1 hour to find out all of the tours were booked for the day. Wasted trip and money.,1
AZM,I was a huge disappointment there where very few animals available to see only 10 main attraction animals I feel refunds should be given,1
Airport,"#AtlantaHartsfield & #TSA Do better. 2 hours at 6:30 am for a domestic flight. TSA line formation, ridiculous, could not be any slower.",1
Theme Park,So disappointed to see how much the cost of tickets has gone up since last year. $84 per person (including my 11 year old) is just too much. After tax that's almost $300 for 1 day at the amusement park. We won't be going back this year unfortunately.,1
Airport,"It's a big airport but it was very dirty, there were garbage all over the place and while I was waiting for my other flight, I was very disgusted to be there",1
Theme Park,I called but couldn't get a person a price or an answer I have a large family I wanted to know about group tates but I didn't even get a recording,1
Museum,I‚Äôm not sure why I spend my money by visiting this place. It reminded me 1998 when I visited Disneyland no new activity for kids overall 20%,1
Aquarium,Hours posted online says closing time on holidays is 6p. We arrived before 5:20p and were not allowed entry. Super disappointing.,1
Aquarium,Over rated. Not at all what I expected. Thought there would be more face to face. U would have to pay extra. Big disappointment,1
Museum,Extremely disappointed to have found that many of the activities or interactions werent even working. Not worth what we spent today. It came so highly recommended. Would have been great if everything was working.,1
AZM,"Lowest service, expensive, concentric destruction land, ruins ruins, worst, will never come again",1
Theme Park,Hey Owner instead of wanting to discuss things further with negative reviewers why dont you just fix the problems!!,1
Airport,I hate this airport. It's too big.,1
Aquarium,Sadly.....not what it used to be....this place used to be a hair from going to Sea World....now a shadow of what it used to be,1
Airport,Wasn't there long enough to find out but I can tell you it was hot!,1
Aquarium,Didn't receive all pictures purchased. Very disappointed.,1
Theme Park,"Don't go to Dollywood
Dollywood is s rip off because none of the indoor singing shows where showing the day we went. Also,  there are no real cooling in the park, if you go to Dollywood go when it's cool outside",1
AZM,Just went to the zoo memorial weekend 2022. Was looking forward to it while visiting Cincinnati.  Was very sad to see all the animals which seem to be sick. The lion was especially sick. Some seemed like they were lethargic. Will not be going back.,1
Zoo,My ONLY criticism of the zoo is their hiring of racist cashiers who single out POC for humiliating treatment.,1
AZM,"It&#39;s smaller than you can imagine, so I don&#39;t think people who think it&#39;s &quot;small&quot; will be betrayed.",1
Airport,"Had to spend 12 hrs overnight in the airport.  I have a disability and everything was closed. No water, no food and no one checked on the passengers.  The T terminal Delta help agent was extremely rude at 6 am.",1
Airport,"Has to be the rudest, most hateful staff I've ever encountered in an airport. Glad I don't fly Delta often.",1
Water park,Absolutely not worth a season pass it was overpriced filthy disgusting luke warm water in the pools and just not professional,1
Aquarium,Much worse after COVID: jacked up the prices but have removed beloved dolphins. What has replaced them isn't as exciting.,1
Water park,This place was seriously expensive for a place where I could only ride 2 things once..,1
Theme Park,Save your money and time...the park for the price you pay needs to be more entertaining...found a lot of areas closed,1
Airport,Airport temperature is too warm. ¬†Pinching pennies at one of the busiest airports. ¬†Hotlanta is correct.,1
AZM,"Parking is expensive, food is expensive, the menu is not varied, and the taste is not good. I&#39;ve been there once, but I don&#39;t want to go twice.",1
Theme Park,For small children only. The pizza pasta buffet was horrible tasting two adults and one child $69,1
Airport,Bad Service. Self Service Booth for checkin not working. Very long Lines for Delta checkin. Prepare to stand in Line 2 hours and more.,1
AZM,Dealing with a foreigner at this price is very expensive and there are many pictures and videos that I do not recommend and thank you,1
Airport,"Why does every fucking airport suck so bad? I‚Äôm so confused why there is a lack of food and everything that‚Äôs here is terrible, seems to be a lacking business model providing decent food and atmosphere. Just one more shitty space.",1
AZM,"The place where the parents backbone is missing Are you crazy about money, and have you bought food from the entrance? Bag check, if this is the money, go somewhere else. . .",1
Airport,"It was absolutely disgusting! Trash everywhere crumbs and who knows what smeared on them , dirty masks and bandaids empty cups it was absolutely gross and I didn‚Äôt see the first person cleaning and I was here for a layover for 4 hours ! Would not recommend and hopefully I don‚Äôt ever have to come back! You‚Äôd think being one of the top airports in the USA they would make it nice ü§¢ü§Æ",1
Airport,"Absolutely disgusting! Dirty masks and bandaids laying around ! Empty cups and crumbs everywhere , wrappers,  a broken off fake fingernail , something smeared on the seats! Wow for such a renowned airport you‚Äôd think they would have better cleaning protocols in place - I was here for a layover for 4 hours and not one person was cleaning anything",1
Theme Park,We had an awful time most of the places were closed even though they were supposed to be open. Most of the staff that was there was rude,1
Airport,"The absolute worst managed international intake I have ever seen, they should be embarrassed.",1
Airport,"Been here several times unfortunately, if I had to guess the only qualification to work here is you have to be extremely racist.  The answers to any question you may have is I don‚Äôt know and no I can‚Äôt help you.  But it doesn‚Äôt matter what your questions are they aren‚Äôt going to acknowledge you anyway.",1
Attraction,"Not a 5 star review
Staff is very grumpy for a kid place. Most of the lego statues need a paint touch up. Spiders webs, walls were dirty, water rides had trash floating. Rules are all over the place from one day to another.",1
Attraction,Came with my 3 year old and there wasn‚Äôt that much for her to do. Long lines and a lot of attractions were closed. Regular ticket did not include entry to either the aquarium or the water park.  Found it pretty boring for adults.,1
AZM,"Unsatisfied with parking, food, and facilities Not enough entertainment for those over 7 years old",1
AZM,It is small for the price and there are no rides to ride.,1
Airport,why have restaurants if they are always closed?,1
Airport,Worst airport!!  Terrible flow through security even with tsa precheck.     Rude staff.   Bathrooms a disaster.  Come on folks you can do better.   Signed a well traveled customer.,1
AZM,"- Waste of money
- Dual Pricing
- Most of the sea creatures were missing/died. - No fun. Boring place.",1
Airport,Unfriendly airport staff across the board and terrible security lines/process.,1
Airport,"Going through Atlanta is always questionable, but it can be hard to avoid. My flight coming in was late. My flight going out was late. Not just a little. Several hours. The restaurant employees were unfriendly, and even refused service, closing with people still in line. There is no way to know what restaurants are open at any given time. Everything is excessively overpriced, even for an airport.",1
Airport,Very uncomfortable for long periods of time,1
AZM,Beer dosent belong in zoo with kids keep it in the beer garden.was at zoo with family dont like seeing parents drinking with their children around.was missing alot of animals also,1

Zoo,"Train ride was overpriced, not alot of animals... Food overpriced. Hours aren't very long.",1
Airport,"Why does a ‚Äúworld class airport ‚Äú close more than half of services, restaurants, etc by 5pm local time?  Better bring your dinner with you!!  Airport/City attorney must not know how to form a good service provider contract. Service is slow. Employees stand in the way and talk to each other. Not easy to find outlets to charge.",1
Aquarium,6 of us went and for 190.00 it was very disappointing compared to all the aquariums we have went to for that price,1
Airport,Nobody helped us so we ended up at the wrong gate.  Literally had to run to make it to the right ‚úàÔ∏è flight,1
Airport,All the restaurants close at 10pm for some insane reason. There are thousands of travelers here as I write this and nowhere to eat. Not a single restaurant.,1
Aquarium,Don't get the city pass they'll make you wait in line for over an hour just to get into the aquarium even though you buy your city pass prior to coming. Ridonculus.,1
Aquarium,Very hard to get ahold of spent an hour Trying to get tickets only to be told an hour laterThey were closed 4 minutes ago it is very frustrating to be from out of town and cannot teach people to visit...very disturbing,1
Museum,"The Outside is better than inside.
We went through the wax museum in about 15 minutes. It was very disappointing. We spent over 60 dollars to see the wax stars. Many of them didn't even look like the people they were suppose to be. I felt this was one of the biggest scams in Branson!",1
Theme Park,Never plan a visit here during a rainy season. They close down every ride if there is any time type of rain. There is also no refund due to weather. $85x 7 down the drain. We only got to do 3 rides. üòí,1
Attraction,"Legoland SCAM ticket sales!!!  If you purchase a ticket and then find out that there are no reservations for the day you intended to go, Legoland will keep your money.",1
Theme Park,"Unable to contact customer service to reschedule my tickets due to a couple of people in our party down with COVID. Legoland customer service, please contact me asap. Thank you",1
Airport,"I've been a lot of places and this is by far the worst airport I've ever been to.

International terminal, everything closes two hours before the flights leave.

Rudest people I ever met.",1
Airport,"Carpet in the gate waiting areas is absolutely filthy.   Stains, dirt, food crumbs, and God knows what else.   D30 gate area atrociously bad.  It's as if no one inspects it. EVER.",1
Theme Park,Terrible we waited in line for 1 hour plus and because of mechanical problems didn't get to ride,1
Airport,This airport used to be amazing not only were the restaurant selections good the environment was pleasant not now they can't keep food service operational nor have enough money to run the air conditioning. Nice work chumps,1
Airport,Parking is a major problem at this airport.,1
Theme Park,If I could give them zero stars I would! Worst customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced! Don‚Äôt waste your money with these people!,1
Zoo,"Maybe i mist it online, but i don't think there is a proper list of exhibits that are closed. It's a lot.",1
AZM,This was the most waste of money ever didn't see very many animals there wasn't any signs to let you know which way to go I am so disappointed,1

Theme Park,Very disappointed in the way my autistic grandchildren were treated by staff.,1
Airport,The worst and rudest TSA ever! Period and upon looking and investigating other complaints for similar reason I am not alone. The rent a cos have quit an ego!,1
Airport,The is the worst airport ever. 9 pm and everything is closed even though the website says it's open till 10 pm. So stanky and busy and you're always delayed because this airport got too big for its britches and have way too many flights. Also they turned the AC off and it is hot as heck.,1
Aquarium,Drove hours to bring my son for his birthday to find out that you need a reservation to go in. When you try to get a reservation the next one is 5 hours away. Basically at the end of the day. How RIDICULOUS! You would think they were Seaworld or Disney World.,1
Museum,"Not worth the money !! No tigers no comono dragon no big tortoise, üò¢ kids were very disappointed  ugh",1
Zoo,"There wasn't  many animal's  there ,I took my grandkids  from California  n the food n gift shop was so darn expensive  , I won't  go back there n I won't  recommend  it to no one .",1
Airport,TSA here is unbelievably rude. It's like they get their thrills by criticizing people in line for security checks.,1
Theme Park,"*0 Stars** Please avoid booking in advance. I have made several attempts to contact the company, via email, waiting for hours on the phone to attempt to reschedule our visit. Save your money, book with company that value your business.",1
Airport,Atlanta Airport has the most rude employees of any airport I have ever been through! I hate this airport! The employees are hateful and useless. I wish I could give Atlanta Airport a minus 5 stars!,1
Airport,It would be really nice if there was more than 6 handicapped parking places in the parking deck coming from somebody who is handicapped and needs help getting in the airport airport my driver cannot find a handicap parking spot or parking spot in general,1
Garden,Cabins are dirty and outdated. Sleeping here literally gave my friends and I respitory issues. I've stayed in cleaner motels!,1
AZM,Parking was too limited and the vendors post one price but charge you more if you're not a member. Classic bait and switch .,1
Theme Park,Definitely not worth the price of admission.  You‚Äôre basically charged a fee to enter to shop and spend even more money!  Many rides weren‚Äôt operating and shows/attractions don‚Äôt run every day of the week.  Very disappointed with the entire experience.,1
Museum,Sorry but 40 dollars and its not that good its boring not gonna lie,1
Zoo,"We got two adults and two senior tickets that cost $75 in total. There were barely any animals on exhibitions, slow service in all restaurants and restrooms very dirty.",1
Theme Park,Splash Country: If you do not have the staff to accommodate the crowd you let in the park maybe you should limit the amount of guests. Horrible experience today.,1
Theme Park,Dolly Parton one of the biggest Fakes ever I'm tired of this place I'm tired of hearing about her I'm tired of hearing about her coat of many colors Dolly Parton can take her coat of many colors and cram it,1
Airport,"The Atlanta airport is a grimy, dirty, messy airport. It is not set up for a Covid world, and nobody seems to care. Further, the ground is littered with trash and the chairs the gate areas are filthy.",1
Aquarium,Very mid. The dolphins and beluga were cool; however the majority of the Exhibits were small and underwhelming. Most noticeable of all was the severe lack of sharks. Overall it was not worth the insanely high price. There are much better places to visit in Chicago.,1
Airport,"Extended layover
Same flight showing at 2 different gates
All Restaurants closed before 945p.",1
Attraction,Their fast past system is ridiculous. A 10 min line turns into 60-70 min due to their system - unethical at the very least.,1
Museum,Not worth the price! Only 40% of the wax figures looked like the real person. The sets / scenes were horrible! Was not impressed couldn't wait to leave!,1
Airport,"7pm on a Thursday and half the restaurants in Terminal E were closed, out of food, or over capacity. Bathrooms were in need of cleaning.",1
Attraction,They made me throw out my lunch and I have dietary restrictions.  Now I can‚Äôt eat all day!,1
Theme Park,Overpriced. They charge you 25 dollars extra for parking and the food prices inside are super expensive.,1
Airport,I observed bad loaders throwing everyone's bags onto the transport cart. I thought man that's not good. When we reached our destination we observed our luggage being damaged by the workers. Mine had two broken wheels. Others had the same and huge dents in the hard case. Very unprofessional and disrespectful. Id fire everyone of them. The Airline was Delta.,1
Airport,Do not come through at night if possible. Had a flight delay and all the food spots closed at 10:00 despite some later times shown on the website.,1
AZM,Harmabe Rest In Peace. Cincinnati Zoo should shut down,1
AZM,It was not worth the money! Very disappointed! Tourist trap! Children will like it but it is overpriced for what you get.,1
Theme Park,"Decent time but I'm thoroughly ticked how they are using COVID to screw paying customers. Every play area is closed, no cash accepted..... they are using COVID as an excuse to do less work. There are no facts to justify closing outdoor play areas!",1
Museum,"Too expensive, they keep the attractions all out of view until you've paid. Then once you go back you realize everything you paid for requires you to have closed toed shoes, me and my 4yo had to leave because there wasn't much for a toddler to do, and we both had on flip flops.",1

AZM,Poor Aquarium and overpriced for a half hour to fourty minutes round.,1
Zoo,"The Denver Zoo was shockingly not good when visiting, if you want a honest opinion I just would steer clear of this place until the bird flu is over, but also this zoo just seems like a tourist trap and was not the best experience, just a lousy one.",1
Airport,"Horrible, dreadful, substandard airport. Staff are so rude and mean. They yell at people loudly and frequently. Possibly the worst airport in the US. Avoid at all costs. Negative stars. They should pay people to fly out of this obnoxiously airport. They basically stink.",1
Airport,"The CLEAR lines have been a disaster the last couple times.  Over 45 minutes today, and they only had one belt working.  Really need to fix this!",1
Airport,Awful airport. Employees across the board at all different places are always yelling at each other and rude. Lately the place has been a total disaster worse than usual. I don't like having to be there.,1
Aquarium,"sorry from Florida, we have really great aquariums. This aquarium is really boring.",1
Theme Park,"Very disappointed, they didn't give senior discount, and the neglected to tell me the water park was closed so i paid 86.99 for nothing i would like to get some money back... Just because i could go into the water park and they didn't give me a senior discount only...i would never go again",1
Aquarium,Somewhat I didn‚Äôt feel good. I wish they maintain even better. Looking at the fish I feel sad. Wish they were in ocean rather than aquarium,1
Attraction,"When I bought my online ticket it said nothing about charging $25 for parking. Ridiculous! If I had known, I would not have purchased my ticket at all.",1
Airport,"Yep I‚Äôm leaving a 1 star review. We get off our international flight at 10pm - we have been traveling for nearly 12 hours and NO places are open for food. Not restaurants, not Starbucks, not even markets. Nothing. This is atrocious way to treat passengers. Eating poptarts like I‚Äôm in college out of vending machines.",1
Aquarium,Website to buy tickets does not work. Then it tells you to call an 800 number but the aquarium isn‚Äôt open. Get people to design your website who knows what they are doing. This isn‚Äôt difficult!,1
Garden,"No dogs allowed. üò¢  Most gardens are pet friendly as long as they are leashed and picked up after.
Here is a small garden with large open spaces and no dogs allowed.   Will spend my money and time elsewhere.",1
Airport,Come prepared to make long lines,1
Zoo,Not worth the money everything closed down.  Not a fun dayüôÑ,1
Aquarium,Not accommodating for those who travel by public transportation.,1
Airport,Welcome to the homeless shelter of airports.,1
Airport,"Hartfield Jackson your parking situation is trash, we waited an hour just to get on a shuttle to a park and ride lot. The Lakes are so clogged with pedestrians that buses can even get through. This is an unacceptable service for the world's busiest airport.",1
Airport,"24 hour airport without 24 hour amenities. Can‚Äôt even eat after 10pm. Single vending machine for each terminal in evenings. Staff don‚Äôt care about anything. The floors throughout the entire airport are disgusting, and the temperature and humidity inside are unbearable. Bathrooms were meh.",1
Museum,Ridiculously expensive and very short to walk all the way through less than 20 minutes,1
Theme Park,"Very disappointed. Unorganized. Activities do not start on time,  you have to sign up for events that book up quickly. Management seems to be unprofessional and unsure of how to organize a theme park at this level. Save your money and go elsewhere.",1
Airport,"Flights always delayed. Do not travel through here unless it is your destination, and even then, reconsider",1
Airport,check in chaos caused us to miss our flight after arriving 1.5 hours before boarding time. now sitting here 10 hours while on stand by due to American Airlines @ Hartsfield Jackson  Atlanta's complete incompetence. #DoBetter #pissed #ruinedFamilyVacation,1
Airport,"The bathrooms were disgusting, customs was an incredibly poorly designed maze of no information. No clue where we were supposed to go what we were supposed to do the employees at the airport were of no help they couldn't or wouldn't answer any questions. I don't see how they could have done a poor job and if only give him one star because you won't let me give zero Stars",1
AZM,"Parking fee of 18,000 won is more expensive than Gangnam in Seoul. I parked it in a wasteland, and it was a big hit at 18,000 won. The city of Chuncheon gives Lego such a privilege!",1
Theme Park,Extremely long waiting on every ride.  There is only one person/worker taking care every single ride!! Why can they just have more people/workers on every ride!?!,1
Airport,"Very poor variety of food choices,  unless you like burgers and fries.",1
Museum,"It's dark and really really loud. It's impossible to understand anything and the ""edutainment""  value here is .. low. Plus, if you bring toddlers, they may be terrified by the noise and flashing lights and shut down completely.",1
Airport,The TSA/Clear was so disorganized.,1
Theme Park,Not an inclusive park at all!  To have a 200 pound weight restriction on most rides is ridiculous.   Will not return!,1

AZM,"A rip off.  To start with, it is not a convenient location to arrive at.  The number of statues are too few for a place like this.  Some of the statues do not resemble the personality being depicted.",1
Theme Park,Poor management and under staff  super long wait time to get on each ride (an hour + )  way overpriced food  and  $27 for one time parking only,1
Theme Park,We have gone to Dollywood before and this year was very disappointing. The shows were short and some were closed. We were so glad we didn't buy the season pass  tickets this time. We are sad to say we won't be back.,1
Garden,Sad the liberals have made it where you can only get a map on your phone. No paper maps.,1
Airport,Domestic Terminal D was very crowded as its very narrow .. Also here found that arrival & departures happen from same gates hence both side passengers to & fro movement creates a lot more suffocation when in between gates are boarding with people in Q.. May be highest passenger is handled but not comfortable with space management in D terminal ( have 5 runways ),1
Aquarium,"Too many people let you in, you can&#39;t even walk or take a photo. People had told me wonderful things about the place but what a disappointment.",1

Got booked 2 days later which costs us a hotel charge, new covid tests (at 200 bucks a pop) then our luggage got lost when we didn't even go anywhere!

Airport,the airport is not organized at all. flights are always delayed,1
Aquarium,"Food sucks, tickets are overpriced, theater show is just scuba diver talking and half the time you can‚Äôt even hear them, over all it just sucks.",1
Attraction,The stuff specially works too slow on rides. Waiting over 1 hour in lines for each ride. The  rides are half empty.  The woman specially works too slow on unikitty's Disco Drop ride.,1
Theme Park,Looks like a great park but they desperately need a course or two of costumer service. Everything was fine until I went to guest services,1
Airport,"Worst airport and service, I have waited more than 2 hours just for the luggage at 2 AM.",1
Airport,NO HANDICAPPED PARKING AVAILABLE!! ALMOST MISSED MY FLIGHT AND I WAS 3 HOURS EARLY!!  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.,1

Airport,"Great service, professional officers, but to loud noise of the guy that is playing the Sax in the wine shop, we can't hear the tripulation staff of the airline!!!!!",1
Attraction,Charging 30 for water park but half of it was closed including Chima and the lazy river.,1
Theme Park,"Best ride shut down for full day for employee executive meeting, clearly shouldn‚Äôt tell customers they are closing rides to prioritize that over customer experience.  The 4d show is the best too",1
Airport,"What and embarrassing to the Austin City, stores had very little supplies, mens bathroom was a state fair standard, dirty with no toilet paper in the stall, broken fixtures. I‚Äôll stop there, this can‚Äôt be the capital of Texas. It remind me of a 3rd world country over the border.",1
Theme Park,"Been going to Gatlinburg for years, would love to go to Dollywood if they had a price for someone that can‚Äôt ride the rides. Would love to go walk around and see what everyone is talking about",1
Attraction,Worst time ever .. if i could i would not give it 1 star at all!!. We drove 6hrs to wait to get check in at 4pm did not get check in until 6 pm . Spend over $1000 for room just to sleep .,1
AZM,"(Translated by Google) The rides are not good and the parking fee of 18,000 won is too much. Too many people, too long explanations, and one ride takes an hour (Original)",1
Airport,"No Coca Cola products sold at Hartsfield ATLANTA? Hello?! This is Coca Cola country and it is just WRONG not to be able to purchase a beverage from an ATLANTA BASED company, not to mention a better product.  Badly done, Hartsfield!",1
Airport,"How ATL only has one major airport makes no sense.  ATL authorities do Atlanta a disservice by trying to maintain ""the world's busiest airport"" while passengers suffer.",1
Water park,Don't waste your money! Not only were prices outrageous but food and drink was scarce. They ran out of food by noon drink machines were empty. When questioned regarding this I was told that the crowds were more than expected so they didn't have enough employees to help. It was a disaster!!!!,1
Sports,Interactive experience was closed due to private event. Should tell customers that when purchasing tickets at the window. The kids were bored and we were upset no rain check available. Private event should be after 5pm when closed.,1
Attraction,Whacked and WOKE workers all over the place.  Boring and expensive as hell!,1
Water park,Well laid out and actually good staff. What they have is well done. It just needs to be bigger to justify the price.,1
Attraction,Sucks! Over crowded.  Everyone crowded in hoards with no shade no music.  People physically assaulting each other and still not kicked out of park.  Poor security not safe and management plus security do nothing. Don't waste time or money you'll regret.,1
Airport,"Ridiculously long lines, poor planning and overall awful airport .5/5 couldn't be worse if it tried",1
Airport,"Worst airport in US. ¬†At pm on Sunday, all the restaurants were out of food. ¬†Don't come to.this airport early.",1
Airport,"Do not arrive after 11:00 pm, as this airport becomes one of the worst in the US. No taxis. ¬†No Uber. No Lyft. ¬†No hotel shuttles. ¬† 45 minutes for baggage claim. ¬†This airport is an embarrassment to the Hartford community.",1
Airport,"My family and I PAY for pre-tsa, while traveling BDL had not one pre-tsa line open. ¬†When asked a TSA rep. ¬†Every excuse given. ¬†Again BDL is a horrible airport",1
Airport,I'd give zero stars if I could. This airport is terrible. ¬†We stood still in our security line until we missed our flight.,1
Airport,"Small airport, yet books like a big airport. ¬†If your flight is at 6:15 showing up 90 minutes early isn't enough to make it. ¬†The service is unbelievably slow and unprofessional. ¬†Honestly I'd rather fly into Boston and bus down than fly to Bradley again. ¬†On par with Detroit, possibly worse.",1
Airport,I've traveled internationally for over 40 years and this was hands down the absolute worst experience ever. ¬†I feel like a criminal assumed guilty. ¬†Wow!,1
Airport,Worst experience at any international airport. From immigration staff to ticket counter and ground staff were absolutely rude. One ground staff member threatened to call police on my my wife because she pulled her own luggage cart.,1
Airport,"This airport is run by a bunch of mouth breathing, brain dead, incompetent idiots who are politically connected and totally incompetent:",1
Airport,It literally took an hour for the shuttle to the park n ride to pick us up,1
Airport,"Shame on Atlanta. Innovating customer care? Yes, it's right before 10pm as I'm connecting flights. Absolutely full terminals everone looking for food. NOT ONE restaurant is open. Vending, less than half work, all with warm drinks after standing in ridiculous long lines. So disappointing.",1
Airport,"I have yet to have a good experience at this airport. Customer Service is the worse. Each time it gets worse. I have gotten so close to asking employees if they are so unhappy why not find another place to work. The older workers are more helpful but anyone under 40 , are just so bitter",1
Zoo,"This place has declined greatly. I'm not sure if they lack funding but the entire place was dirty, many if the exhibits were unkept, for the first time in years I felt genuinely sorry for the animals.  It used to be so well managed and clean and happy. I was disappointed.",1
Sports,Very rude and disrespectful staff. We came from VA and was treated very poorly. Wont be coming back nor recommending this place to anyone.,1
Airport,This is so funny the restaurants are still as nasty as downtown restaurants. Come on san antonio could do better ! When will people respect themselves more enough to show other people respect and that comes with the whole experience.,1
Zoo,The seagrill needs someone who moves faster than a snail. It took half an hour to order and half an hour to get our food,1
Airport,"0-5 in going through Atlanta and once again stuck sitting here, in the middle of the night, with yet another delay. I would give zero stars if I could. I will never fly through here again if I can help it!!!!",1
Theme Park,Pride all over Legoland.  Legoland should indicate supporting Pride all over the park on your website.,1
Aquarium,"time slots are pointless, the aquarium is way too packed. they should probably fix this due to how much money people spend.",1
Museum,"Super rude employees, there is no information about activities or tours, super packed, lines for everything.
Simply a waste of money.",1

Aquarium,"Animal look so sad. They should close this place ASAP ! Place was sooooo crowded, you were able to smell the COVID all over the place !",1

Zoo,Elaborate grounds with few animals. Paid $10 for two cups of Coke with ice. Tourist trap.,1
Aquarium,"Too much people. Too crawled. They shouldn‚Äôt let that much people in.
Not possible to enjoy",1
Water park,Was only able to do the last river and the wave pool. All the slides had over an hour wait. Definitely not worth it for the price they charge,1
Theme Park,Gonna be opiniated didn't care for it went many years ago nothing has changed long lines for 10 second rides just over priced carnival that never changes money not well spent Disney or Orlando is the way to go,1
Zoo,Barely saw any animals.. they were all sick for some reason. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs due to the living conditions that they have to endure. This is the worst zoo experience I‚Äôve ever had. Smh.,1
Theme Park,I would rather hike in the smokies for a day as to wait in a 2 hour line for a 2 min. ride,1
Airport,This place is so overly complicated.,1
Aquarium,"Update - not any better, too crowded, they force you to exit through the gift shop... Trash for families that already fought the crowds.

Talk about a trap, not enough room or exhibits for the price.",1
Airport,"Terminals  D are to hot ,USB connections between seats brocken.
Please check and maintain your airports. Very disappointed. Floors are filthy, from bathrooms coming bad smells, probably sewer gases,and food is served very close",1
Airport,Cancelled flights unexpectedly with no one to explain anything. TSA speak to horribly....etc,1
Airport,"Disappointed ‚Ä¶NO WATER!. Busiest airport in the world almost completely shut down at 9:30pm with thousands of people connecting and walking around. The one store open was out of water.  Vending machines were full but did not work. Not a single airport manager or supervisor around to help.

We have the greatest airport in the world‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs run it that way!",1
AZM,"Not worth even 1 star No Lego discount No entrance fee discount LG says yes No parking fee discount Basic 188,000 won to parking fee for a family of 3 Plus 189,000 won Legos are ripped out No outside food allowed. Inspection at the entrance Pasta pizza buffet 25,000 won per person",1
Aquarium,"This place ended up making us really sad. The tank for the beluga whales was tiny, and they just kept doing flips because there was nowhere to go. Also, not nearly enough room for the massive whale sharks. The sharks seemed bored. It just overall seemed really inhumane :/",1
AZM,Easy to get lost. Couldn't find the animals we were looking for without asking zoo workers for directions. The maps were no help,1
Museum,Kinda disappointing half of the stuff doesn‚Äôt work. Basically just a glorified arcade. And there‚Äôs a constant screeching noise throughout the entire thing because of one of the rides.,1
AZM,"I wish there were more places to sit and rest. Parents can&#39;t rest in places like children&#39;s playgrounds. I wish there were more coffee shops. Something uncomfortable and unnatural movement.. Lack of staff.. Overall, it was very disappointing.",1
Aquarium,"Pulled off the line going in by two of the angriest young black security guards. Not nice at all and had me empty my pockets, open my glasses case and then wand me. If they were nice and friendly it would have been okay. Ruined my day.",1
Airport,Two people working. 25 people in line at all times. Bad management. They take advantage of a captive audience.,1
Airport,Stinky bathrooms because the automatic urinals were broken.,1
Theme Park,It‚Äôs started raining I had 10 tickets along with 2 Childs tickets and they didn‚Äôt even refund nor give us a rain check on the tickets,1
AZM,Are there any amusement facilities that aren&#39;t in Seoul that charge so much for parking?,1
Zoo,Man this place really charges you a lot of money now. Used to be able to come here for less than 30 bucks for a family of 5 now it‚Äôs close to 100 bucks for us to come visit!,1
Airport,"Could you guys please stop announcing the amenities your airport is providing, it is just annoying to hear multiple times about your free wifi service, air cleaning system,etc. It is very annoying",1
Museum,Absolutely WILL NOT do this EVER again. 20 minutes of just taking pics for $74.00 Total total DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!üò°üò°üò°,1
Theme Park,My 7 year old son is very upset because his architecture LEGO of Liberty of New York which he bought 2 days ago has lack of parts/pieces on the pedestal.there are also parts that he ended up using it even if the colors aren‚Äôt match in order for him just to finish the construction.,1
Theme Park,"Food is awful and overpriced.
Staff not very helpful. Most of the interactive displays are broken.",1
Airport,"Why do vendors close at 9:00pm, no food, nothing to drink, everything is closed. Busiest airport in the world but no vendors for the travelers arriving and changing planes at night. Totally ridiculous, I will try to avoid this airport going forward.",1
Theme Park,I was wanting to go so bad it's was a disappointment. I will say the brisket sandwich was good and I found a pig for my kitchen. I think Six Flags over TEXAS IS Better.  We rode the rampage it left bruises on my legs.,1
Airport,We got stranded there overnight. No place to get a bottled water everything closed. When we ask security if they had vending machines they said no they had drinking fountains which I thought everybody quit using those after covid. And they weren't very clean. And then places that were supposed to open at 6:00 a.m. did not open till 6:30 and everybody was just outright rude.,1
Aquarium,Animal cruelty at its glory. The idea of holding social and smart animals in captivity is gruesome. Gets even worse when the animals are kept on tanks too small for their size. Those animals were screaming for help. Truly sad.,1
Theme Park,"Rude rude rude!!
As a handicapped person I was shooed away from parking even with a placard. The staff was a bunch of barney fife rejects",1
Airport,"They don't play ""Welcome to Atlanta"". Very disappointed.",1
Theme Park,"I bought a ticket for the cable car, but instead of a ticket, they gave me just a receipt. The seller said that I just need to show the receipt to the conductor and the conductor took the receipt from me and said that this is the ticket. Is this legal at all?",1
Airport,The international shuttle is horrific and Sorry,1
Theme Park,Was very disappointed that you can‚Äôt buy a season pass to only splash country. This is ridiculous and guess we will be going to Soaky Mtn,1
Theme Park,The Pizza Buffet was closed. They promote online that there is food for all. We stayed for hours without eating because of the ridiculous prices.,1
Theme Park,From the time we got through the booth at the entrance it took about an hour and a half to finally get to the park.  It was awful  !!,1
Water park,The concrete is hot and gave me blisters  on my feet why don‚Äôt you water it down or let us wear shoes,1
Museum,Not worth the money.  They haven‚Äôt updated anything since I was there about 8 years ago. Multiple things didn‚Äôt work or was out of order. Will not be back.,1
Airport,I could not talk to a person. No one even tried to help me. If you are that independent then I will go some where elsE. YOU DIDN'T EVEN RETURN ME PHONE CALL.,1
Airport,"Come on BDL, you are better than this. Denver, Las Vegas, and Baltimore all on the same baggage carousel and over head announcements constantly yelling at everyone about the confusion you set them up for. You did this.",1
Airport,It would have been fine except that I was singled out in security after going thru the xray screening-I ALWAYS wear simple pull on clothes with no metal-the woman put her hands EVERYWHERE on me-she was disgusting-no reason to treat me like that-I DO NOT WEAR METAL ITEMS IN MY PRIVATE AREA!!!,1
Airport,40 minutes for a gate to ‚ÄúOpen up‚Äù?  This was a scheduled arrival!!!,1
Airport,"traveled twice from this airport. twice my luggage was lost. do the math. everyone in uniform had no idea where to direct me, continuously i was pointed in all different directions. truthfully i would stand at the door of this airport & pay for passengers to travel elsewhere if i could afford it.",1
Airport,"Why are the planes, flying so LOW!

Airport,Security lines the longest I‚Äôve ever seen at any airport! Beyond ridiculous! Poor management!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Airport,"Landed at Bradley airport early from Philly. Can‚Äôt get into our gate because a fuel truck is blocking our way. Sitting here for over a half an hour while the flight took less than that. 
Poorly run airport with no consideration for passengers.",1
Airport,Bradley airport treated and handled my parents situation unprofessional and poorly. I‚Äôm so disappointed and this is one of the many reasons why I travel through JFK. Bradley will you and jet blue take responsibility for your guys mistake ? And the poor treatment of my parents and my elderly and disabled grandparents.,1
Airport,Horrible airport. People are rude and you can get anywhere nonstop. Plus you will dramatically overpay.,1
Airport,TSA staff very rude and standing around talking.  Too many of them for size of airport.,1
Airport,"Retrain your baggage people, awfully bad service in departures and arrivals",1
Airport,The baggage process is so painful. Nothing has changed in years and years. This is my last choice for an airport due to this poorly operated system.,1
Airport,I would think in 2021 this airport would at least have feminine products in their bathrooms and kiosks‚Ä¶ what a nightmare to be a female in this place‚Ä¶ in this day and age it‚Äôs amazing that this place is so set back they do not have feminine products to purchase in restrooms‚Ä¶,1
Airport,"It‚Äôs a disgrace, not even 8:00pm and all the vendors in both concourses are closed. Except for a crappy McDonald. It will remain a hick Billy airport.",1
Airport,Why do you let Uber/Lyft drivers fill the cell phone lot? They sit around in folding chairs like it's a tailgate party waiting for a fare. Meanwhile regular people picking up family and friends have to circle the airport constantly or pay to park.,1
Airport,"Bradley International Airport - BDL looks like a ghost town, due to all the cancelled flights. #WinterStormElsa WFSB - Channel 3 Eyewitness News",1
Airport,LONG lines at Bradley International Airport - BDL this morning  #NBCCT,1
Airport,This customer is the reason why a lot of employees are leaving their fast food jobs because of people like her Treating the Dunkin worker at Bradley Bradley International Airport - BDL like trash and humiliating her in front of everyone she was also an American Airlines employee at the same airport it‚Äôs sad to see this type of nasty behavior!,1
Airport,Car got stolen no issue if you drive a dodge car and park there for a little while it will get stolen.,1
Museum,"Save your money...Dirty, overcrowded, and everything is broken. Like an expensive chuck e cheese with fake educational value.  All rides running at half or low capacity to keep you in line and fit as many people as possible in the upside house. Low ventilation and breathing on each other.",1
Attraction,"So far so BAD, late check in, wrong room, hungry children, broken toilet and Uncaring manager.
I‚Äôll keep you updated..",1
Airport,"After a long day of travel, I was subjected to the saddest excuse for music blaring from a Chipotle cleaning crew just after 11 PM. ¬†Airport staff yelling to each other down the halls. Everyone was tired and annoyed because of long flight delays and cancellations. This did not help. Control your staff.",1
Airport,"Get some damn places to eat that are open till midnight!!1 place open after 10, look at the line. This airport sucks.",1
AZM,Worst zoo ever been to. The people were unpolite unprofessional. They act like it's a government building or prison you're going to. family and me eat in the cafe and first they did not bring all the food we ordered and then we found plastic in are food.,1
Zoo,"Go every year... But first time since the pandemic.  Never been so disappointed, hardly an animal to find.",1
Airport,"How are you going to tell me the vending machines are closed!? Concourse D one set of vending machines was completely empty. I walked to the other end to find vending machines with actual beverages only to be told they were closed. Not not working, not unavailable. Just closed. Worst experience",1
Airport,"This lot is huge and there is lots of traffic. I got into an accident there the other day because there are no stop signs anywhere and not even surface markings suggesting where to stop. This is a really dangerous lot. If you go here, please be careful and watch out for other vehicles.",1
Airport,Ehhh... To many rude people from other places.,1
Airport,"Atlanta TSA employees are the worst ever, they are rude for no reason. I‚Äôve flown out out of Atlanta several times and always disrespected by TSA for no reason here.  I‚Äôm a 65 year old man and it‚Äôs embarrassing the way they treat me and talk to me.",1
Airport,bathrooms were dirty not working...airlines tell you to get there early for friggin flights and the people who ticket not there until after 8 then you walk your bags and just toss in area...then one security tells you one thing and another has a different story...no at all a even passable airport...,1
Aquarium,Over crowded asl if you get a cheap/free ticket then cool but don‚Äôt pay full price to get in,1
Theme Park,If I buy tickets online there should be a separate line to get my passes. Ib shouldn't have to stand in line with people buying.,1
Museum,It is advertised as a muesuem but once we got in we found out its justa. Glorified arcade area with maybe 2 intresting exibits. Half of the stuff inside doesnt even work MAJOR SCAM do not go inside,1
Theme Park,Not a place you want to go!! Overpriced and not organized,1
Aquarium,Long wait outdoors and overrated. Not worth visiting!,1
Attraction,"I think this is the worst place in whole America. No good rides and nothing. No fun. Don‚Äôt waste one day in your life by wasting time here. For Lego builds, one hr with 30$ should be enough. You can find these type of rides every where. Disney is far far better.",1
Airport,"This airport has always been garbage. If you're going to make travelers have 3 hour layovers, then you should keep all your restaurants open and stocked with product until the airport closes. Bad business practice. AND NO COFFEE ANYWHERE! THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!! THAT'S INCREDIBLY DISRESPECTFUL TO TRAVELERS!!",1
Theme Park,Nothing special. Funny their laser show said they debuted 1983 but idk if their light show has changed since the 80‚Äôs. It‚Äôs pretty  rough,1
Airport,"Bathrooms, I went to two different ones and they were both gross",1
Theme Park,"No shade, long lines,  app to buy food (what?!), bought an $8 hot dog that had a stale bun, and $25 additional for parking (ack!). Staff were very nice though. Would not recommend unless you are absolutely desperate to spend too much money.",1
AZM,Very disappointed with this zoo drove five and a half hours there definitely was not worth the drive,1
Museum,The whole place is just a money making scam. Nothing authentic.,1
Airport,I‚Äôd like to have the airport with signs allowing those that are walking on the escalators to head left and those that just stand to move to the right. We‚Äôre missing our flights.,1
Aquarium,Way too crowded! There were lines on the stairs in the parking garage.  They need to stop allowing all the oversized strollers.,1
Theme Park,Some chick named kierra or something like that who was working at the swamp thing is extremely rude! won‚Äôt be visiting again.,1
Theme Park,"Still under construction lot of rides are not working.

And the game stalls like Ninja Games are also reap offs. Even if you win they do not agree to give the winning price.",1
Theme Park,"Not Equipped for large crowds. Poor directions to poor. Not enough rest rooms.
Poor choices in available foods.
Especially on a big holiday there should be more food selections and bathrooms.",1
Airport,"Delayed plane due to having to go to customs. Plane is here but needs to go to customs. WAS told our plane is not a priority so we have to wait. This happened 5 mins before boarding. Atlanta airport is a joke. We are all dealing with short staff issue's, deal with it and compensate those you screw over that thought they booked with a reliable airline.",1
Theme Park,They need to do a better job directing traffic after major events.  Stuck in parking lot for over 20mins that's unacceptable.,1
Zoo,"animal abuse
enslosures were TINY. ESPECIALLY FOR THE ELEPHANTS. this is animal abuse. 20$ to ses miserable animals pacing around and bored. never again.",1
Theme Park,"Raining, kids frustrated, waste of time and money, and no refunds

AZM,far too expensive - tourists pay more than double the price if tourists...,1

Airport,Customer service in almost every restaurant is terrible and short staffed.,1
Zoo,"Half of animals were gone.The water in exhibits was green and gross.The exhibits were bleak and I felt so very sorry for the animals.It used to be a nice zoo,not it's TERRIBLE.",1
Aquarium,"During July 4th. Holiday weekend it was packed. Very crowded and very uncomfortable, could not view the shows.",1
Museum,"Skip this attraction
They let entirely too many people in this place at once. You can‚Äôt even move around much less do the activities. We brought seven our our scouts here and pretty much wasted 275 dollars. Will never return.",1
AZM,The Cincinnati Zoo has a lot of animals that most Zoos around America do not have. They have a high amount of animals from Africa and a live Cheetah show.,1
Theme Park,"Came for the ""bike trail."" Turns out, it's just the road (for cars mostly) that goes around the mountain.  You can ride yr bike on it, just like you can ride your bike on almost any road in the entire country.  Couldn't even relax on the ""great lawn"" without paying an entrance fee.",1
Aquarium,Too expensive.  The activities don't equal 25 dollars for a 2 year old child.,1
Airport,"Absolute worst. Unless a limo is dropping you off. People working the airport are extremely rude and ride pickup is at end of the parking lot. Very, very mismanaged, yet funded by my and your tax dollars.",1
Theme Park,When I put the rubber mat thing in the shower. It was covered with presumably women's hair given the length. Just nasty AF.,1
Aquarium,"Look, fish are cool. Underwater mammals are cool. But a shopping mall sized beluga jail with questionable labor practices, highly questionable ethics, and the sussiest sponsors (looking at you Southern Company)is not the way to enjoy looking at them. Hotdogs aren't bad.",1
Theme Park,Still a historically racist venue despite the attempt to whitewash it. Laser show only gotten worse over the years.,1
Airport,no where to get something to drink or eat other with cash. Not even the vending machines accept cash. Overcrowded.,1
Airport,Charging ports at Gate D9 are not working. I tried to charge from 5 different sockets/ports but no action,1
Airport,The woman at the TSA was nasty to me and don't appreciate the way I was treated plus she took a few things of mine that I paid good money for and just bought them on my trip.  They were not dangerous items either.  I hope she gets fired for that.  Deserves her right to treat me like that!!!!!!,1
AZM,Very pricey for what there is to do. Disappointed for what I had expected,1
Airport,Has probably the nastiest bathrooms I have ever seen in an airport,1
Attraction,"Park extra mild. Wait times are unreasonable (throughout most of the day, close to an hour for most rides).",1
Aquarium,They have gotten rid of a lot of animals when I was younger they used to have great whites and all kindsss of sharks now all they have is like 3-4 shark rays and like 5 tinny 3 foot black tip sharks and alot of other things they barely have anything anymore,1
Museum,Crowded to the point of danger. Expensive. Pointless for adults.,1
Aquarium,"Didn‚Äôt even go to the aquarium but the whole process of buying tickets online was a mess. First time I tried to purchase tickets the system failed and so I thought I needed to purchase tickets again, but I was charged twice.",1
AZM,"It cost nearly $40 a person and only lasts about 20 minutes, shortest and worst aquarium i have ever been to!",1
Theme Park,"Very dissatisfied wanted to take our boys on the train ride and as soon as we got down there it was shut down and we couldn‚Äôt ride and no refund , wish I. Hold give a 0 stars we definitely won‚Äôt be back",1
Theme Park,Worst place ever rode 2 rides closed due to lightning in the area. Didn't offer to come back or anything ridiculous prices,1
Theme Park,"Update: I emailed them and nothing was corrected.
Do not book with them. They will not let you cancel NO MATTER WHAT. I'm sure plenty of people with covid decided to go instead of forfeiting their money. Another reason Florida is the epicenter of covid.",1
Attraction,There isn't enough space for everything wrong that happened. Check trip advisor for full review. Would not recommend to anyone planning or saving for a family vacation. Staff is burned out and won't help you. Expect for your children to miss out.,1
Airport,Atlanta Airport sucks!!! Everybody should be aware  when they park and what its left in the vehicle.  Our vehicle got broken in and we paid $85.00 at covered parking  and nobody cares . People be aware !!,1
Airport,"Worst airport I‚Äôve seen and I‚Äôm traveling all around the world. We missed our flight connection due to the waiting at The border.

We are like 150 ppl like this in the queue.

Never going from there again.
Most of the time the staff were arrogant and disrespectful.",1
Airport,Unbelievable how awful this airport is.  And they don‚Äôt care at all.,1
Airport,I missed my connection flight thanks to the border control security.,1
Airport,Pay your workers more and you would probably have enough staff to have things run in a timely matter. Very disorganized trying to get a wheel chair as well as there are never enough shuttles.,1
Airport,"Extremely poor management, here is the proof, unbelievably long line for security check, FFS",1
Airport,"This place ia the worse airport I have ever been in. What a joke and the staff was unfriendly, unkind, rude and simply not knowledgeable about the airport.  They put us in a hotel after causing us to miss our flight . Which they blamed each other for. Vouchers were useless.  Beyond irritated with my experience here .",1
Airport,"1st time at MSP. This might be the worst airport layout I've ever seen, especially with regards to baggage claim. No signage to indicate there is a 2nd set of baggage claim carousels, and people movers on the floor above, but go ahead and 3alk 3 football fields of length to get to the last baggage carousel. Just poor design.....",1
Airport,went to the restaurant on e. everything comes in plastic or on plastic other then the glassware for drinks. they only have one type of jam. if you flights delayed you can't get coffee unless you go through security. they make it difficult to get to the airport from 494 as well. why can't they have better signage on the freeways?,1
Airport,"Terrible airport, wait too long at the security checkpoint",1
Airport,Flew in yesterday from Cancun on a connecting flight Minneapolis on Delta going to Chicago. The flight was delayed and over sold. The lady and the guy that was working at the gate for flight DL1625 where very rude and unprofessional. I wish I would of got their names. Delta you have to do better.,1
Airport,Wow has this airport gone downhill in the last few years,1
Airport,"Nothing but bad experiences. There is only one reason it‚Äôs the highest rated airport‚Ä¶it‚Äôs in Minnesota, and people from Minnesota don‚Äôt complain.",1
Airport,Everything closes at 8pm and no smoking sections!!...lame!!,1
Airport,$28/day for parking? Absolutely insane. The security lines are extremely long as the TSA agents here are barely functioning. People running any of the small purchasing stations have no idea how to do the simplest of tasks. Pretty unbelievable this place doesn't implode,1
Airport,"Lots of window dressing and retail/eating opportunities - IF you are not catching a late or delayed flight. Zero food, drink, anything after 10:00. You can't even get coffee.  Also no TSA pre-check after 8:00 pm.  Not a traveler friendly airport.",1
Airport,"Moving from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1.
Had tight connection but plane arrived early.

Ran, ran, ran & then WAITED WAITED WAITED for a light rail.

Very, very inefficient.
Exceptionally inefficient.",1
Airport,"Woman named Mulu, the cashier at the parking ramp is an absolute jerk. Didn't seem to know what in the world she was supposed to do, could not speak clear English and had the audacity to yell at us. What a psycho! Tsa are always terribly rude as can be. One of the worst airports.",1
Airport,Don‚Äôt use delta for your airline. They absolutely suck with approving real service dog teams and they let in fake ones instead,1
Airport,"I guess if there‚Äôs a slight chance of lightning in the vicinity, they can‚Äôt put your luggage on the carousel at baggage claim. So here we wait‚Ä¶..",1
Airport,Not friendly for foreign nationals.. too confusing,1
Airport,I‚Äôd give it 0 stars if I could. Worker stole my sunscreen and I want it back at least when I get back to this airport. Terrible. Security guards made me severely uncomfortable. Very easy to get around but that‚Äôs about it. Everything else sucks.,1
Zoo,"Under construction
Paid $80 and drove from Texas to visit.Most exhibits were either under construction or closed. This was not worth the money nor the trip. I have been here many years ago, and it was great. Such a disappointment now.",1
Theme Park,"Highly disappointed that you no longer have veggie burger option, my family used to be happy that you at least had something to eat for us vegetarians. Now you have beyond burger which is for previous meat eaters who don't want to eat a plant based diet and not for someone who is vegetarian.",1
Aquarium,"I've been here before a couple of years ago as a kid and had a blast honestly but, but now u have to buy a time slot for either 30 or 40 mins when it takes at least 2 hours to see every exhibit :(",1
Aquarium,nightmare getting in. queuing with none ticket holders despite pre booking tickets for some reason and missed our entry slot because the queue is so long. why bother booking a slot if you just make us queue with everyone who doesn‚Äôt have a ticket,1
Attraction,"Nobody ever picked up the phone! No matter what time of the week or day! Booked and paid vacation online, did not receive any confirmation email. So dysfunctional!",1
Zoo,This is a place where rich people can go look at animals that are in prison for some reason.  unfortunately poor people are not allowed due to the high admission cost.  it is unclear to me why the animals have been imprisoned.  But I guess the law is the law no matter how unjust,1
AZM,I thought it was a little pricey for what you see . The one in bass pro shop in Springfield is much better for the same money well worth the extra drive to Springfield mo.,1
AZM,"Not impressed
To expensive for what you get to see.I have been to other aquariums that have much more to see that isn‚Äôt as expensive as this one.",1
Airport,Airport needs a upgrade.  Lighting is poor and terminals look out date,1
Museum,"Not as educational and hands on as I would have hoped for. A bit superficial, entertains but not much substance.",1
Airport,Facilities are not clean and staff for Air Canada were terrible and absolutely insulting to passengers. They literally made a woman travelling with two kids cry.,1
Museum,We paid for timed entry felt extremely overcrowded and it was difficult to navigate. Several of the exhibits were broken and I left underwhelmed compared to Florida and other exhibits with similar themes. Bottom line: did not feel like we got our money worth would not go back.,1
Museum,horrible WAYYYYY over priced alot of the stars didn't even closely resemble the person will.never go back don't waste ur money,1
Airport,It's a absolute joke . I've never had this many problems . Someone needs to be fired,1
Museum,"Not worth the money for sure$100 and we couldn't even walk there so many people nothing to do there, again, you wanted waisted money, go ahead, never again",1
Zoo,Very disappointing this time around. Half the animals were gone. The animals that are there you just feel bad for them. The one monkey they have spends his days longing out the window. Definitely not worth the money.,1
Airport,"Never had an on time flight.  Always delays.
It should be called ""Flight Delay international airport""",1
Airport,"This airport is the most unorganized and inefficient airport in the world. I've been to 154 countries several times so I say this with experience. From check-in to security to gates to baggage service, it's a disaster. F terminal has passengers here for hour's. A decent restaurant or coffee place would be great.",1
Museum,Don't go on a Saturday in July the place is 85 degrees inside and the tram ride is about 114. My baby had a heat stroke and none of the staff were trained or even offered to help him.Fly high my little angel,1
Airport,"When the wind comes from the southwest, this airport has planes taking off so lowly and loudly over the Shearer Hills/Ridgeview neighborhood that it triggers extreme anxiety and heart attacks!!!!",1
Theme Park,"What a nightmare. ¬†Lines are insane for rides. Walking paths are overly long and windy. God help you if you want to eat. It's online, you have to create an account, and then wait an hour for them to text you to pick up your food while you and 1000 other people vie for 20 tables. Never again.",1
Theme Park,"Waste of time and money
Many of the rides were closed down, there weren't any demonstrations and they only take credit at most locations. It was difficult to get free water. You had to pay $3 for a bottle of water and on a 100 degree day it got to be very expensive.",1
Airport,Not much to do too hard to get to gates long security lines even for tsa precheck and the teams are filthy and people are rude,1
Airport,Horrible airport. Even if you have clear or TSA Pre you are treated bad. You are not spoken to politely and treated unfair.,1
Airport,This airport is absolute hell! Terrible service and I absolutely hate flying through! They definitely aren't disabled friendly and if you ask the guys driving the golf carts around for a ride it's going to be hit and miss!,1
Airport,"Very disappointed in the monitoring and enforcement of people properly wearing masks. ¬†Many people here today not wearing masks including Security, Clear employees, and travelers and I don't see people actively doing anything about it today from when I checked in to arriving at my gate. ¬†I've been flying throughout the pandemic and this is the worst that I've seen.",1
Airport,"What a stupid airport. There is NOTHING to do in this airport while you wait for your ride to pick you up. I have a two hour wait. Two people told me that I could go back thru security and walk the shops, but when I tried, TSA sent me to the United counter. The United worker told me that I'm NOT allowed to go back in and shop. What a waste of time",1
Airport,"We landed at 7:30 pm and quickly found out there are almost no food options available. Staff kept saying it was due to Covid, but with thousands of people coursing through the airport looking for food, and all the options closing early right in front of them, it's poor management. Consider this when flying through MSP.",1
Airport,"Most likely the worst airport I've ever visited, and I travel extensively. Really confusing transportation between terminals, awful TSA pre-check service, and no food options in terminal 2 unless you want to fight someone to get in line for Subway. Feels like the state of MN is literally trying to punish anyone trying to travel in/out of state. Get it together.",1
Airport,I had an early morning flight. Had to be dropped off the night before. ¬†Not a resteraunt open in the whole damn airport and they wouldn't let me back in if I left to get food. ¬†Ridiculous.,1
Airport,Love this airport for its cleanliness and atmosphere but goodness gracious those TSA agents are ruthless. They could really afford to add some signs with directions so they didn't have to verbally abuse travelers for not being kind readers. 10/10 recommend paying for pre check so you don't have to deal with the people who hate their lives as much.,1
Airport,Under staffed. ¬†No common amenities without traveling vast distances. ¬†Second time I have been on plane and everyone accounted for 20 min before but we had to travel to the other side of county to take off,1
Theme Park,"A waste of time & money!!
Don‚Äôt waste your money, go somewhere else! Only three things were open for our 4 year old to enjoy. The food was horrible and the tables were very dirty. Laser show and the fireworks were awesome but had a hard time following the story. We will NEVER return!!",1
Theme Park,Severely disappointed.. lots of ride breakdowns. Two of the rides closed due to breakdowns. Wont go back.,1
Theme Park,Worst scheduled park I've ever been to stuff was supposed to open at one time then only opened  and hour later. The park attraction scheduleals are all over the place and far from Accurate. On top of all that everything is chepply thrown together and is a grab for your money.,1
Water park,Went there today only to find that the 3 best rides were closed. Almost bought the fast pass glad I didn't. They should update website when rides are down,1
Aquarium,Honestly pretty disappointed went for an aquarium what I got was a glorified food court don't waste your time go to Ripley's aquarium in Tennessee so much better,1
Theme Park,So far we have been here for 2 hours and have managed to only successfully ride 1 ride. 3 broken and now have been in line for 30 mins for a ride that on the app claims to have a 5 min wait.  So far negative stars for the garbage I have encountered.  County fairs are a significant upgrade.,1
Theme Park,Park is clean and all but each ride took forever to get onto I think they should really sell fewer tickets in order to better manage lines or implement something I don‚Äôt think 1 hour + per ride is worth it and waiting this long with a little one =\,1
Aquarium,$142 for 2 adults and a 3 yr old/with parking 4 blocks away.,1
Garden,"Even though we had a ticket, most things were closed. That was very disappointing. Also bugs are mad crazy here",1
Zoo,"What do you call a zoo with no animals?
The place isn‚Äôt even trying right now. What do you call a zoo with no animals?  Point Defiance. Don‚Äôt bother this year. There is nothing to see.",1
Museum,"This museum is downright creepy, will NOT be going back.",1
Theme Park,Not family friendly. They don‚Äôt like families with little kids.,1
Attraction,"Not impressed, kid are ready to leave after the long lines and lame rides. Will not be returning.",1
Theme Park,"Long lines, overpriced, and nothing is marked well.   Never coming back.",1
Airport,The staff checking bag extremely rude for no reason. Tried to be polite because I know not easy job but extremely rude. Nothing worse than the workers at food court. Especially Villa Pizza. Horrible experiences at this airport. Obviously staff doesn not want to be there or be welcome.,1
Zoo,"Soooo bummed out. My husband & I were so excited to go.. 75% of the animals were not out. Really... how do you consider that worth coming and checking out. I feel like we were completely ripped off. We had fun, and the few animals we saw were fun, but, it definitely wasn't worth it.",1
Airport,"What a dump. Fix the train, the baggage claim, and hire some less oblivious staff and security. Oh, and the emergency sirens during no actual emergency. If you land here past 11pm I apologize",1
Attraction,Very disappointed with the caricature that we had made around castle hill. Looks like the artist is on a hurry to take her break so the output looks like it was made by a toddler. Spent around $200 for it only to kept in a closet instead of hanging it around  our home.,1
Airport,"If employees, including TSA, were restricted from using their cell phones while working or in the middle of servicing a customer, things might go faster and be less stressful.",1
Theme Park,"Park Ranger Jim is so rude as he refused to offer those LEGO guys to my poor son! He said ""just go"".",1
Theme Park,This place is an outrageous ripoff. Ticket prices don‚Äôt cover any games. The shows are overrun with Christian nationalism and other political ideologies. Go read a book instead.,1
AZM,Well that was a disappointment‚Ä¶. We were so excited and it started off great but we were done in 20 min and we didn‚Äôt rush at all‚Ä¶ for that price I will never do that again. Spend your money in Springfield at the bass pro aquarium !! 2 plus hours long and we‚Äôll worth the money!,1
Theme Park,"All the rides only had one train running so it was a hour wait for each ride. Also, instead of merging the fast pass and regular line, they just have the fast pass people jump in the seats that you're about so sit it.",1
AZM,All the animals were not in there habitat didn't get to see anything that we were looking to see.,1
Water park,Serious issue with line cutters.  This needs to be supervised.  There we no available handicap parking spaces.  Unacceptable.   They need around 200 more lawn chairs.  But they make more money with cabana for rent.  Stick to a hotel pool.,1
Water park,"They need more shaded seating areas.  Very disappointed with the wave pool; not much in the way of waves.  The best part for the kids was the fire house, wish it had a little more.  They need to revamp the lazy river, expand as it's so over crowed.",1
Museum,We are local to the area and trying out ‚Äúthings we haven‚Äôt done‚Äù.  We did the maze of mirrors only and it cost over $30 for 2 people.  This was way overpriced and we were in and out of the maze in 5 minutes. There are better mirror mazes in the area and I felt robbed for the price.,1
Attraction,"TBH the little shop in AZ is much better and cheaper. Not planning on returning. :/ It plays on 'pay to play' so after paying for tickets you got to pay for games. The rides there are just copies of themselves themed as something else.

No worth the price you pay",1
Zoo,Very disappointed in our zoo visit today. Hardly any animals there. Main aquarium closed. No place to eat.,1
Theme Park,"No longer a motorcycle friendly park. If you ride, take your money somewhere else",1
Museum,Prices online do not match prices of that when you go there. Bathrooms are very small. Did not get to see some of the animals because they weren‚Äôt out. Which it‚Äôs hot I understand but I thought this place had more to offer than the animals and that wasn‚Äôt really the case.,1
Attraction,Very disappointed. Favorite water play was not available,1
Airport,"Worst! Traveled through Atlanta twice in the past year and worst experience from customer service, delays, cancellations.  I avoid this airport if possible.",1
Theme Park,the staff is horrible. i came here with my summer camp that i work for & they expected us to do everything. the kids would ask for help & theyd stand there. also had them cursing around the kids & smoking a vape around the kids,1
AZM,place is a joke bought 2 tickets. then got sick with covid they won't let us use on another day,1
Airport,Tsa is soooo slow and inefficient,1
AZM,I wouldn‚Äôt suggest this place to anyone and if I could give negative stars I would they will accuse you of molestation without proof and then ban you after they confirm you did nothing wrong. If you are a man stay away,1
Airport,Security took so long we missed our flights.   People working there are extremely rude.,1
Airport,Waiting more than 20 minutes for shuttle at terminal A,1
Airport,Should be called the worlds worst busiest airport. Instead investing in tvs and holograms you should invest in more lines and more employees!,1
Airport,"I have never left a 1-star review, but this place has earned it. TSA lines backed up beyond belief, then once you finally reach the front, you‚Äôre treated like you are the reason for the disorganization. TSA agents don‚Äôt communicate clearly, just loudly. After security, you end up with extreme lines for all coffee joints and more disorganization. Do better.",1
Aquarium,NO DOORS ON THE WOMENS STALLS IN THE RESTROOM????? Why??? Evidently women don't deserve any privacy while using a bathroom??? Unbelievable! I can't even get my money back because it's on a city pass!,1
Theme Park,I won tickets in a contest that legoland would not honor very bad customer service,1
Zoo,Was just there I think they abuse there animals they all look sad and depressed,1
Theme Park,"Horrible pool and lazy river water. Gross, will never go again.",1
AZM,The price of admission was outrageous!  If you buy anything at the gift shop bring your own bag. They don‚Äôt give you one of even wrap breakable. It‚Äôs really sad.,1
AZM,They went up on prices just to take away the free drinks with the 2 day pass! Definitely a Bummer when you have a large family!,1
Airport,Filthiest airport I have ever seen. Fast food and wrappers all over the floor. Lazy cleaning people just pushing around carts without actually cleaning.the photos were taken in the cleanest place we could sit. Had to pick up trash left on seats to sit down!,1
Zoo,"Boring
Add animals!!! Most cool exhibits were closed..not worth it anymore very sad!! It used to be a nice place to visit.",1
Airport,One of the worst airports. Everything there was closed by 8:30. Pretty pathetic for such a large hub.,1
Attraction,"From my previous experience, this time it was worse. Alot of the rides were closed and the water park attractions were also limited",1
AZM,"The weather is hot, but there is no shade and there are not enough chairs to sit on.",1
Airport,"Be prepared to wait for too long for immigration if landing here .

Unfriendly staff, luggage handling was not safe.",1
Museum,Layout was weird and there exhibits weren't all together,1
Airport,Hello. It was horrible. The gate was unorganized. The volume was horrible and the passengers could not hear the agent.,1
Theme Park,Why is the only rollercoaster in the park always broken?,1
Museum,Very confusing.. if you purchase a ticket it has nothing to do with the tram ride.,1
Airport,The one escalator to off field ground transportation never works.,1
Airport,"Coming in from London I'd ask for wheelchair & it NEVER came. Plane  they were cleaning  completely emptyed, & still no chair.  That's rediculas,",1
Airport,Don't close every food and snack establishment at 7pm...it is absurd. Absolutely nothing open and many flights past 7pm.,1
Aquarium,"It is cruel, animal abuse to keep whale sharks, beluga whales and dolphins in captivity. It is a death sentence for these magnificent creatures. release them immediately!!!",1
Theme Park,Extremely uncoordinated. Hotel host/hostess is completely useless. Also had to have my park tickets printed and apparently the entire hotel had no ink in any printers so my barcodes didn't work on the printed tickets. If they can't afford ink it should let you know how poorly this place is operated,1
Airport,"Fly out of Austin, this is the most poorly run airport in the nation. ¬†Elevators, escalators, and restrooms are broken almost on the daily.",1
AZM,While my family was there a security guard unlawfully detained my brother in law and accused him of groping a child. After he was proven innocent because he didn't even match the description they banned him for life. I will never go there again,1
AZM,Very unhelpful staff. Overpriced. Very short museum. Avoid.,1
Theme Park,84.00 for my ticket.2 hour lines.Would never go back.,1
Museum,It wasn't that impressive. People were messing with the props. They made the wax sculptures not like the actual People. Very disappointing. Don't waste your money. VERY EXPENSIVE,1
Water park,"Very disappointed! Lots of rides down,out of food at a lot of stands and no ice for drinks. It wasn't cheap to get in and we had to leave early to go eat and get drinks. Definitely did not get our money's worth.",1
Theme Park,"Not friendly to fat people, don‚Äôt expect to get on most of the rides, and it‚Äôs a definite no on the big ones, a huge waste of money",1
Aquarium,"Completely overpriced for what‚Äôs there.  Very crowded.  Often found that the exhibit descriptions didn‚Äôt match the exhibits.  For $175 for a family of 4, I expect better.",1
Attraction,Unprofessional workers lazy. Lines were long obviously but overall everything overpriced just for some 5 second rides. Wasted my time lot of things that are awful and wrong. Don't come here,1
Attraction,"Their marine life could be a bit better.. the staff is okay and could use some training on customer service especially when working with children, maybe we'll try the hotels service next time instead of the park.",1
Airport,Impossible to find Uber staging area,1
Airport,Acqueline Scott was being pushed out of the will hair by a supervisor cause she was moving to slow  to get up her name is jayle,1
Airport,Delta has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They would rather argue with a customer and treat them like they don't matter and all the money they spent does not matter. This airport is poorly structured and does not invest in quality employees.,1
Airport,Doesn‚Äôt even deserve a star; who manages the shuttle intervals? Because they must have severe brain damage.,1
Aquarium,Terrible Facility. Keeps whales along with other animals in tiny concrete tanks. You shouldn‚Äôt support a company such as the Shedd aquarium.,1
Airport,Not great they never have enough security.  Some crazy B!+#h yelled at my Grandson for taking two seconds to long to go when it was our turn. They customer service is ok would be faster if all there fingernails weren't 3 inches long and to type they have to peck at the key board. I don't recommend this airport if I can avoid it I will.,1
AZM,I want you to return the money because you can not experience both attractions that you want to experience in the main when you go due to maintenance,1
Theme Park,"No experience
Lower the prices we could not afford to go there. That is one of the places we wanted to go but could. We had a group of 9",1
Theme Park,"It won't stop anyone from coming, but we had the worst experience here of any theme park we've ever visited. Two hours waiting in line then they shut the ride and give us one skip the line pass. It's embarrassing.",1
Airport,"Out of all of the airports I have been at, this is the worst for any kind of customer service.  The people at the airline and stores were universally rude.  They acted like they were doing you a favor by even listening to you. I am a New Yorker, so, given my background,  this really means MSP is at the bottom of the barrel.",1
Airport,CARD ONLY EVERYWHERE. SO ANNOYING.,1
Museum,Some of the wax figures where very poorly done along with no names and info on several of them.   Will not be returning.,1
Zoo,I want to remind everyone one.  Right in the start of the mask mandate they were changing people $15 bucks for a $1 cloth mask.  That was before the state made it mandatory. Thanks for sticking it to all the families that visited then.,1
Aquarium,Was not impressed wirh the aquarium. It felt like deja vue.,1
Theme Park,"Paid over $300 and only was able to stay for 3 hours due to ""rain"" it was cloudy and all the rides closed. Some rides were closed due to lack of staff and the park was just dirty. I expected more and my child was disappointed as well. Wish I could have received a refund",1
Aquarium,Very Saddened by our trip...We drove 4 hours for Shark fest is what they stated and only 2 sharks....Family was very disappointed all 7 of us,1
Museum,"The ticket policy might be one of the most absurd policies. My children (24,16& 12) had 3 paid tickets (thru my PayPal) and my daughter had to repurchase and I had to call and get a refund. Very frustrating & inconvenient. Way to ruin a fun sibling day out.",1
Airport,Another crappy airport where you can't get food after 8PM or crap food after 9PM. Bars close at 8PM wtf!,1
Aquarium,Here now worst experience I have ever had here in the 12 years I have been coming here on this day for my son birthday. There are nothing but  Ignorant people here.,1
Airport,Was praying in the prayer room. Security kicked me out and followed me around the entire airport. I Had a flight to Orlando. Delta took care of it.,1
Museum,Not worth the money. Say it would take 1 hour to 2 only took us 20 min at most. Over $100 for 2 adult and 2 kids not Wirth the money,1
Theme Park,"There is no one to speak to, in advance before your arrival, emails go unanswered, and my response takes 7 to 10 days, as indicated in the email. The customer service is HORRIBLE. I will never suggest anyone visit this location. BIG MISTAKE: bringing my grandkids and not happy so far",1
AZM,Junk junk junk since 6 flags dipped out. DO NOT DO NOT GO ON A WEEKDAY!!! Half the park was closed along with half of Hurricane Bay due to them not wanting to use elec and water i presume Pretty sad to see once a great park turn so Junky. At least have discounted weekday ticks.,1
Zoo,Pretty disappointing as nothing was open n all the animals were put away n nothing to see n too much walking for naught. Boo!üò¨ü§ê,1
Theme Park,"Legoland customer service sucks.  The general manager, Jesus, lacks insight to issues and obviously is only interested in$$$$$$$$.
So unlike a Disney experience.",1
Airport,"Your airport had the most hassels, no vending was all empty and was filthy",1
Airport,The worst experience this year.,1
Airport,"Horrible place. 3 hour wait in precheck line today, TSA agents give conflicting and rude directions to everybody. Cockroaches running through the delta terminal.",1
Airport,"I always dislike coming in and out of this airport.
It's just too big and too crowded",1
Airport,Not a safe airport. Don‚Äôt trust ATL with your vehicles.,1
Theme Park,If Your do anything at all.  And yourself from the horrible food at the kickin chicken in the park. 50 dollars and we threw it all in the trash. Literally the worst experience I've had with food ever. Even the fries were unedible,1
Water park,This place sucked. Couldn't do any slide. Way too overcrowded. Too much money. Take soaky mountain over this. That place is much less crowded and much funner. Do dollywood over splash country. Lastly this place is way too small.,1
Aquarium,DO NOT ATTEMPT TO GO TO THIS AQUARIUM ON A SATURDAY IN THE SUMMER! Whether it's entry. Cafe or exhibits there will be hundreds of people on line in front of you and it will be difficult to see or do anything! It looks like it would be wonderful but the crowds kind of ruin it.,1
Aquarium,"This is one of the most miserable places I've been too. It's so disappointing to come to a place to see the sights and all you see is unruly children, rude parents, and disrespectful people everywhere. It's so overcrowded that it's best to see it from Google at home. Sad.",1
Attraction,Here now. No scooters since they are for hotel guests first. My daughter is pushing me in a wheelchair. She has a bad back. Anyone know ADA legal matters to demand first come first served?,1
Aquarium,"The Georgia Aquarium targets me with ads on twitch constantly that insinuate gaming is not a ""real experience"". This is a disgusting advertising tactic from an immoral industry. I'm not going to visit your aquarium and support the imprisonment of large intelligent mammals, sorry not sorry.",1
Aquarium,Too small of an area to walk no place to set too many people it's all about money not the animals. I will not be returning Myrtle Beach aquarium is much better,1
Airport,The single point of security for all airplanes means that your wait times through security is worse than airports in nyc for instance that take a lot more flights but are not stuck this way . I‚Äôve experienced lack of electricity in atl airport once and have also experienced being stuck on tarmac coz replacement light bulbs for plane couldn‚Äôt be found easily .,1
Airport,Hard to find food. Music blasting over the speakers is so bad I'd rather be jabbed with a screwdriver than listen to it. It is horrible! I gad a hungry kid do had to order a $15 grilled cheese (!!!!) through a qr scan program. Kid would have been happy with $5 nuggets from McDonald's. But mostly the music made me homicidal.,1
Airport,"Terrible airport, had a connecting flight and they made us run around for hours with gate change, delays, and cancellations all to end up getting a hotel at midnight.. I would‚Äôve rather driven 1800 miles.",1
AZM,Very disappointed  most of the animals were not on display unless you took the truck ride into the big open area  and that ride was always a 1 hour wait  time,1
AZM,102 dollars for a family of 3. It's very small and takes about 30 mins to go through. Most of it was looking at the same aquiriums from a different angle. Save your money and take the short drive to Springfield and see what an actual aquirium is suppose to look like.,1
Airport,"It was dirty.
There were cockroaches crawling around Concourse A where passengers were waiting to board their planes.
Horrible experience.",1
Theme Park,"It is not worth it to pay any penny... It's not good for the price you pay...
The offer legosh+",1
Theme Park,A horrible experience they sell the tickets from the front gate they didn't inform us that the park games close from the whether they open some Restaurant and the indoor games when we back to the front entrance to get ask refund they give us a link to Complain but the link not working,1
Attraction,Way to expensive for whats there. Twenty five dollars to park is ridiculous! San Diego zoo has free parking and much nicer. Never going back.,1
Theme Park,It's was my niece n nephew first time visiting. It was very hot. Not all the water fountain was working. water was not cold when you purchase them.. Pizza and Pasta restaurant food was terrible I spent $50 for nothing. Need more options for bigger kids. Water should be cold when purchase.,1
Airport,What a steep decline in amenities for international travelers. Only ONE halfway decent restaurant left open in Concourse E (One flew South). ¬†Missing places like cafe Mozart ...,1
Airport,"Mass confusion with pick up.Terminal B... Security or whatever he was, wouldn't let me park, to pick up my friends. He said keep moving, even though my friends were exiting the door. He was very rude .. so I had to go all the way around...",1
Airport,"I wanted to send my two children on a flight back home. I stupidly chose San Antonio international airport. They wasted my my time for 2 days in a row, I could tell these workers are obviously new, they had no idea what they were doing. I would not recommend.",1
Airport,Very poor set up. Slow customer service. Very confusing no help. Overall really frustrating and bad.,1
Airport,"This place is an absolute mess right now. Cancelled or delayed flights were the norm, and most employees had just had it.",1
Airport,the signs pointing to the next terminal and gate was horrible.,1
Theme Park,"There was no ice available ANYWHERE in the park, not at food trucks, not at restaurants in the park.  It was 100 ¬∞!  NOT A FUN VISIT DUE TO  HEAT!",1
Museum,"Such a disappointment
Very disappointed. Kept wondering when I was going to get to the interesting parts of the place. Came to Houston for this. Wish we wouldn‚Äôt have",1
Theme Park,"Do not recommend, terrible management, disappointed with food choices. Most rides broken, and unsafe to use!",1
Airport,"delta NIGHTMARE! 

Honestly the worst airline experience we have ever had! If you are traveling this summer‚Ä¶ we hope this helps you when choosing an airline carrier. 

Make sure to share with someone who needs to see this. ‚úàÔ∏è #deltacancellation #deltadisaster #deltaairlines",1
Airport,"I was always impresses with ATL but after today never again. Restaurant closes at
8.30 no food long queues for the few open. Terrible rude could care staff, understaffed, grubby lazy service eg ceased salad but no utensils or napkins. Half the menu was unavailable after waiting 10 minutes",1
Airport,945 pm and the restaurants were out of food or kitchen closed,1
Airport,"The men Restrooms were terribly unclean.
And the assistant to do the check-in was very rude.",1
Airport,"Concessions are terrible! Poor service, takes over an hour to even find and then procure even a cup of coffee! Also very very rude concession workers!!!",1
AZM,Way overpriced for the size of the aquarium! Travel an extra hour and go to the aquarium in Springfield.,1
Theme Park,I was unable to ride but 1 roller coaster because I was either too tall or my legs were too big. I wasn‚Äôt even able to get a full refund. If you‚Äôre even remotely big don‚Äôt waste your hard earned money. I won‚Äôt be anymore,1
Theme Park,"Legoland is stupid
The place is ass it was raining and when the rides were dry they waited for it to rain again by making the ride go with no one on it 9 times.",1
Airport,"Rinky-dink airport. Bars are closed. Everything else is closing. Can't even buy a water because there's no vending machines. This is my 2nd least favorite airport (right behind Chicago). It is small though, so that's the only redeeming factor. Best advice: avoid Sacramento. Ban Spirit airlines. And avoid the Chicago O'Hare airport at all costs",1
Airport,Worst airport in the United states staff is rude. The plane train is too fast and throws you around. And when did it become socially acceptable to bring your dog everywhere,1
Water park,"Very small place for too much money. Plus $25. To park way the heck far away.. most of all not enough shade , chairs or tables to eat at! If your going to overfill the park at least have areas to sit in shade! Heat stroke city!",1
Theme Park,Change in parking is terrible. It's more difficult for older customers. Entertainment on July 27th was not good.,1
Museum,It was overpriced for the old and faded wax figures.,1
Aquarium,"The only way to purchase Shedd‚Äôs tickets is online. It‚Äôs a scam. They charge a convenience fee. If you are not a Chicago city resident or on SNAP, it is pricey to take your Family! Grandchildren had more fun at Millennium Park playing in the water, which is free!",1
Aquarium,Your check in process for the city pass is an absolute nightmare. Not worth having to stand in line for 40+ minutes when you‚Äôve already paid. Absolutely ridiculous!,1
Garden,"Waste of money
Too expensive for food and hotel room. Toilet wobbly. Lake water very dirty and beach cafe horrible food. Too hard to navigate through the gardens.  Restaurant staff not friendly in piedmont dining, not enough variety of food.  Same kids menus every day",1
Theme Park,"Waited in lines all day just to have  breakdown after breakdown  then got vouchers for front of line just have another breakdown, here all day only to be able to ride 3 rides , definitely recommend spending you hard earned money elsewhere",1
Theme Park,"Don‚Äôt waste your money. Rides shut down repeatedly. Unless you pay extra for the timesaver pass, you will watch the same people ride multiple times while you wait in a line that doesn‚Äôt move. Many other great theme parks to choose from, this one will waste your time and your money.",1
Museum,"Over priced.  Crowded  and more than half the things did not work, was broken or did not work properly.  Was there 5 years ago and it was a great experience  but it has gone down hill.  Even restrooms were bad.  Recommend spending the money on the boat rides or zipline....",1
Theme Park,"Terrible theme park, rides break down every 2-3 runs. It is a shameful that this park has Dolly Partons name on it. Absolutely atrocious and waste of money from this scam of a park.",1
Museum,"Not impressed, lines too long, cost too much, just an overrated tourist trap",1
Theme Park,I'd rather take my money up to cedar point it's almost half the pry and way more fun. They can't even give an estimate for maintenance and I honestly only came here for that ride. Never would have payed 85$ a ticket for this,1
Airport,Absolute joke how far they moved rideshare.,1
Theme Park,The park supposedly closes at 10 pm but most of the rides were closed by 7 pm... very unhappy,1
Theme Park,Exceptional customer service! Every single person was friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit!,1
Airport,If you want to see why we can't have nice things: the genius who put the cell phone lot immediately next to the south terminal which has 3 of its 4 arrival lanes blocked by construction should have to stand out there and direct traffic as the one lane stops for crossing pedestrians. I was trying to get to the North Terminal.,1
Airport,TSA security agent yelled at me but wouldn't instruct me what I was doing wrong. Completely unnecessary. Complained at the podium about his passive aggressive attitude and he got called out of line by his leadership on the way to my flight. Not sure what it is about that profession that attracts the worst people. Gate C14 was full of litter. Not impressed Atlanta.,1
Museum,"Food is terrible, and terribly over priced. Their BBQ sauce tastes like ketchup with seasoning, and the coleslaw was made up of 75% mayonnaise, walking around trying to enjoy this place with my family on the cusp of throwing up, if I do throw up, ima make sure it's all over the carpet or a display.",1
Aquarium,"Way Too Crowded
So many people inside that it ruins the experience. How can you enjoy yourself if you can barely move? What is the point of having a timed entrance ticket when they sell so many of them? Just a horrible day overall.",1
Zoo,It is so expensive! How are families supposed to take their kids?,1
Airport,This airport sucks ! You might as well be in a Communism state because they won‚Äôt allow you to smoke on property. I guess they don‚Äôt care about losing high end clients in their flights ! I‚Äôll never fly anywhere they doesn‚Äôt allow my freedom to choose !,1
Airport,"Delays, delays! Came in in a late flight and all the restaurants, shops, and stores were closed!",1
Airport,"The lack of signage to let travelers know which way to go when arriving, nevermind having one inundated worker in the rental car department, then, if you're lucky, you will find the rental garage but the lack of any signage or help how to find the rental cars the lack of people available to direct anyone To do anything with travel on a Friday is a real fault.",1
Theme Park,Park opens at 10am most other places such as eateries shopes didnt open until 11 1130 so why open at 10 if you cant get something to eat or go in shop or some of the attractions,1
Airport,Global entry is useless in this garbage airport if you‚Äôre sitting at the luggage carousel for over an hour waiting for your bags.,1
Museum,Useless visiting this place without making a reservation to the tram tours. How is one supposed to know there is a reservation required for a team tour,1
Theme Park,"like being locked in an empty broken down ice cream truck with the music on as load as it can go.  if you enjoy waiting in line for over an hour per 2 minute kiddie ride, having your teeth pulled, or DMV this is the place for you.",1

Airport,International travel so bad. You have to line up to get a shuttle to take a Marta train.,1
Airport,Smoke free airport... not flying through there again.,1
Museum,"1st floor is basically an arcade and designed more for little kids. Very noisy and reminded me of Chuck cheese. 2nd floor was better with optical illusions but unless your kids are under 8, I do not recommend.",1

AZM,They charge foreigners 3-4 times the price. Not cool at all,1
Airport,"There was not one nice person in this airport!  Every worker was rude and loud, yelling at people!  No help at all.  Went to check bag and lady would not check my bag bc she said I could go the other line and do it myself!  These people need to learn some kindness!!",1
Theme Park,The park is to small and the ticket price is to expensive. Sorry but i won't go back again,1

Airport,"Rude employees, long lines, contradictory signage, TSA Pre closed. Avoid if possible.",1
Museum,"Very outdated. Paid way too much money to see the same outdated collection. No sports heroes, no Friends display...seriously?? No superheroes?",1
AZM,This was absolutely horrible. There were no animals at all and it was a Saturday? And after baking in the sun all day the roaring springs ride wasn‚Äôt even open for us to cool off. HORRIBLE,1
Airport,It's a very dirty place! Needs to be cleaned3,1

AZM,Nothing much inside.just waste of money.I regretted.,1

Airport,Nasty and not very stocked all vending empty,1
Aquarium,"Don't beleive what they say on the website. This place does not have staggered entry times. There was like 5000 people in there, the line ups are about 45 minutes and it was really not enjoyable. Basically a covid breeding ground.",1
Attraction,Long lines for everything and the fast pass holders continuously jump ahead of you with no system to keep things fair for those waiting in line for hours.,1
Theme Park,Ok so I was gonna bring my kids and their friends to your resort but because I heard what was happening on the News I've changed my mind... thank you but no thank you,1

Airport,Terrible confrontational aggressive check-in.,1
Theme Park,"Not good customer service

AZM,"It was a pity that some of the rides stopped and the follow-up measures did not work properly, such as taking a long time to check.",1
Museum,"It's a good experience for anyone, even if you are not interested in the space ‚ú®Ô∏è lol.  My only complaint is the food court.. the line was way to long and they didn't have enough people, you can use the self check out, but still didn't work.",1
Theme Park,Be careful the gimmicks when buying annual passes. No customer services at all to answer your questions.,1
AZM,"Do not go! We went last year, it was great. This year was understaffed, floods of people. 45 min wait really was 2 hours. This Zoo has changed so much. Save your money.  This zoo is all about saving their money and charging you more.",1
Airport,"Poor security speed, badly organized",1

Museum,Outdated and loud. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you‚Äôre childless.,1
Zoo,Was not worth the money. zoo as a whole is rather dirty and only seen a quarter of the animals that they have. All the glass on the enclosures were dirty and scratched so bad if there was animals you wouldn't see them anyway,1
Airport,Crazy busy and people sprinting all over to get to their gates since the airport is so big.  Also obviously Delta is the main Airline.  They are horrible so it reflects poorly on the Airport.,1
Airport,TSA and restaurant staff were very rude. They need a customer service manager,1
AZM,Watch out all British tourist  your be charged twice the amout of the Thai nationals,1
Museum,"If you‚Äôve been to madame tussauds you‚Äôll probably be disappointed. Not worth the money for what they have. It takes maybe 20-25 minutes. Add Hannah‚Äôs Mirror Maze and really get taken for your money, we were done in less than 5 minutes.",1
Theme Park,We bought gold passes and we had 4 referr a friend tickets and they didn't let us use them on Friday and Saturday. They should let us USE THEM ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WHEN PEOPLE ARE OFFAND WANTING TO HAVE FUN. üñïüèª,1
Museum,Very unorganized and little interesting historical info. Trolley tours were not worth it unless riding down a street you can drive down to look at buildings is interesting. Tour guides were very rude and unfriendly.,1
Theme Park,"Lines were super slow and maintenance happened on 3 of the 4 i road. Was there for 5 hours. Waste of time, go to 6 flags !",1
Theme Park,Why is customer service so poor at Legoland resort? We have only been given the run around for our now stolen Nintendo Switch!  No has contacted us and the management team has been anything but stellar. We will have to seriously think about ever returning!,1

There was a pot with Mac and cheese that was old but someone put in in the cabinet
A lot of spiders",1
Museum,Completely over priced and crowded! Alot of stuff in each level was broke also. I would definitely not do again with my three kids. The whole upper level is just a arcade that you have to pay again for.,1
Airport,This was the worst experience at any airport I've ever been to this far. A international airport with on check point. Literally hundreds of people flying out. Get it together MSP. I hope to NEVER fly from terminal 2 again.,1
Airport,Airport dining area near baggage claim was disgusting. Employees were very rude and there was trash and spilled drinks everywhere ü§¢,1
Aquarium,Insanely packed was not able to see everything due to so many people there will not go back.,1
AZM,After spending several hours there we were unable to ride a single ride or get in the water due to about 5 minutes of rain. When we inquired about a raincheck we were told that was not an option because the park was still open despite EVERYTHING being shut down.,1

Airport,One of the worst airport to transfer between international and Marta/domestic.  1 hr to get to domestic.,1
Airport,"The airport has 4 elevators that go to the long term garage, but only ONE works.  Why??  Allocate some of the funds we pay on taxes & fees to fly to fix the other three elevators.  We should not have to wait 15 minutes for an elevator.",1
Airport,"Power is out, random stores are closed and nothing from the airport about what‚Äôs going on.  Americas best airport this is not",1

Airport,Avoid this airport at all costs üëç,1
Aquarium,"The worst aquarium in my life! First you have to go through the quest of buying tickets - good luck if you're not from Chicago or even USA.

All in all- you better spend that 120$ elsewhere",1
Theme Park,It was very expensive and lines were very long and we got stuck on a ride,1

Airport,Always crowded and somewhat dirty at 10 pm. A long walk to anywhere.,1
Aquarium,Not worth at all. The ticket is super expensive than the fun you get in there. Kids might like it due to the animals but the ticket should definitely be at least halved.,1
Airport,"This is one of the saddest looking airports I have been in, nothing is open Except for only McDonalds any good restaurant and bar are closed. Bad enough their food is horrible yet they want to charge premium prices. What else can you expect it‚Äôs Connecticut",1
Airport,Zero social distancing. TSA made it worse since they were waving to people come on,1
Airport,Long line to go thru TSA security early in the morning.,1

Airport,"Rude staff, especially at Spirit Airlines.",1
Airport,"Today I am going to miss my connection as BDL is taking 90 minutes wait time to deice planes. Really unacceptable timing, the airport didn't plan enough crews to handle a small 4 inch snow storm? The storm was forecast a week ago so there's no excuse for not being prepared, plenty of time to prepare.",1
Airport,Food options very limited after 7. Only McDonald's üò°,1
Airport,No one explains anything. Flights says on time but your sitting for a half an hour after the doors are supposed to be closed. And then you wonder why people snap at persons at the airport . No communization then you have people just waiting as if they don‚Äôt have plans. Unprofessional place. I hate that I have to Travel from this location. You guys really suck.,1

Airport,"Terrible customer service,  long lines at 5am! We need to expand! Just a thought üíô",1
Airport,Poorly managed airport. We have lived in multiple states and have never experienced such a poorly designed facility as it never has sufficient parking. I dread every time I have to go there.,1

Airport,Old place.  Dingy.  No amenities.,1
Airport,Terrible really bad really really bad,1

Airport,"Worst airport. Unclean and the people who are managing American Airlines cause a lot of inconvenience to the passengers.

Theme Park,"Very disappointed. In addition to not being allowed to use your phone on the ride, the overall experience was subpar. Certainly need a breath of fresh air with staff and focus on the customers experience. This does not represent the Florida resort well‚Äî CA is up nextü§ûüèæ",1

Short timed rides , over priced food even the ticket prices are too high for what they offer definitely 1st and last time there .",1

This place is a joke. Long line for very few ridiculously short rides. Seems like a racket to buy trash food and overpriced souvenirs. Regret spending $450 on tickets and $25 on parking.",1
Theme Park,"$30 for mandatory parking seems excessive. Nickle and dime felt like the name of the game. $90 general admission per person, $20 for a soda cup, $16 for a burger, $60 season pass, basic level ... And then $30 to leave. Really leaves a sour taste.",1
Aquarium,Wasn't worth the money we paid to get in. I thought doing scheduled entries into the aquarium will help with the number of people looking at the exhibits. I was real worried about going to get COVID by how many people was in the facility at one time. And no social distancing,1
Airport,Delta ruined my return from Alaska,1
Theme Park,"Went last September Short hours , half the stores/shows closed and only found one indoor restaurant to eat at. Don‚Äôt go during end of August to beginning of October!",1

Theme Park,"If a pen is $3.99 each and if you buy 5 then the promo is 5 for $15 .... then why is the discount  for ""pick a pen 5 for $15 promo"" only $2.95.. .. $3.95 times 5 is $19.95. The promo is $15 so the discount on my receipt should of been $4.95 not $2.95.",1

Attraction,"Worst ""customer service"". This place is a scam if you're not careful. Bought add package along with staying at the hotel  and we couldn't use any of it. For example, the all day dine, everywhere we went to didn't accept it and they refused to refunded it. On top of all this, the places were dirty.",1
Airport,Worst experience with the staff . Atlanta need to hired new people with good costumer service.,1
Zoo,"It seemed as if quite a few enclosures were empty. Additionally one of the aquarium buildings was closed. We have been to zoos in San Diego, St Louis, Portland, Chicago and lots of aquariums. This was a very small place with have the animals missing.",1
Airport,"Workers are not honest, list and found is a joke. Airport police don‚Äôt exist and I fell and hurt myself and not one person helped   I will never go back.

AZM,Who‚Äôs genius idea was it to get rid of 70% of the lockers in the water park so that they are sold out within hours of the park opening ?????  Making it impossible for two people to ride any water rides.,1
Theme Park,Not for me. Doesn't mean it isn't for you just not for me.,1
AZM,"Don‚Äôt even waste ur money to come here is horrible, it takes 3 hours to ride 2 good one attraction, food sucks, bathrooms horrible is just everything,  don‚Äôt do it just DON‚ÄôT!!",1
AZM,walked in earlier today and an employee walked up to me and hit me in the nose with a metal bat purposefully for seemingly no reason. he then hit me in the back of the head with it twice and i fell onto the ground and he lit me on fire. will never be returning.,1
AZM,"Way too little staff to hold Amazon and UPS on a Saturday, very poor planning. Also the amout of people getting sick and well contamination is considering. I was warned that it's a place going down hill looks like that's a fair warning. Maybe it's best go somewhere else for your trip.",1
Aquarium,I don't recommend anyone coming on summer weekends. It was grossly overcrowded today. I left after an hour which was at huge travel and admission cost.,1
Airport,"Rude employees and most of the sinks don't work right in the bathrooms.  But, what choice do you have?",1
Theme Park,Old run down hotel and the service was horrible. I feel like customer service is gone.  If you can find someone.  Staff shortages food buffet was closed gave us a small trey instead,1
Aquarium,"The website states Summer Hours 8-9am today (Sunday August 14th), however, after a few more clicks it says on the calendar they open at 9am. We found this out after we were in line at 8am. Bummer.",1
Zoo,"Don't work here, especially in Security.  They say they have your back, but they don't.  They say one thing,and do another.",1
Zoo,Outside snack place will sell you cold beer but hot water in a bottle who in the world sells hot water bottles in 90 degree weather! Who ever is in control of the stand should be fired for serving customers hot water bottles!!!,1
Airport,Worst airport ever. I always have to connect from the International terminal to the domestic via the shuttle service. Wait times between shuttles is so long that I always miss my regional shuttle from the domestic terminal to my town. Who planned this awful system? To have no trains between the two terminals leaves us waiting for hours.,1
Theme Park,"Over priced, whatever systems they ran interfered with my hearing aids. Also when time to leave, couldn't without walking back around the whole park due blocking the main though fair for filming. All around bad experience. Will never go back and would not recommend to anyone.",1
Theme Park,Grossly overpriced! I understand charging more in the park but the prices are super high... legalized robbery.,1
Airport,"The shuttle between the domestic and international terminals is extremely slow. Supposed to run every 15 minutes but we waited at least 45 minutes. And then the driver had the nerve to have attitude that people weren't standing behind the right line üôÑ. He said there were 2 shuttles running, but they need at least 4.",1
AZM,"This park is a joke.  Don‚Äôt waste your money or time.  Sat in traffic to turn into the park for over an hour.  Rides weren‚Äôt working, over crowded,  won‚Äôt be back üôÅ",1
Airport,"i thought hell was thousands of miles under the earth, turns out it‚Äôs in georgia. avoid at all costs. confusing and slow",1
Theme Park,Customer service is shit. ¬† If anything goes wrong good luck getting in touch with an actual person. ¬† Worst experience I ever had with a company.,1
Airport,"ton of walking, parking confusing. for mid tier airport, not good.",1
Attraction,"Absolutely disappointed. It is so sad and run down. And it is so much more expensive than Disney. Please, if you value your time and money, don't bother! Water park and all rides are 42inches so don't bother with small kids
Everything is not awesome.",1
Theme Park,This place is awful. It would be better to take the kids to a carnival or water park and buy them some legos after. Worst theme park I‚Äôve ever been to.,1
Theme Park,"Don't waste your money, go to the florida one
The park is very small and  always busy, no entry from the hotel nor any priority.The staff is great! Still go to any other  one, we have been to London and Florida, is a total different (much better) experience",1
AZM,The was not fully open and lots of activities closed today üò°üôÑüëÄüò≥,1
Theme Park,"Terrible experience
Terrible experience, the park staff was extremely unaccommodating in every single way!! We tried to get in touch with the staff prior to the visit nobody responded. The park was hot and boring. I‚Äôll never go back there!",1
Water park,"Long lines, overly crowded, lack of seating, not much for toddlers",1
Theme Park,This place is the worst place that I ever been to overpriced I will never bring my family here again not even my dog if you like garbage place this is the place to go to,1
Airport,Commie airport only takes credit cards now no cash accept it,1
Theme Park,We baught our tickets and they were closed I am not impressed Dollywood,1
Theme Park,Little shade. LONG lines for literally a 30 second merry-go-round (went around twice). Parking is almost $30 per day NOWHERE did it say we would be charged to park!,1
AZM,Why are the tickets so expensive? $44 per person is unreasonable and unaffordable.  With inflation costs this is ridiculous.  Consider low income families that want to bring their children here. It shouldn‚Äôt be MORE than $25 per person.,1
Airport,"Worst airport I've been in my life, spent 3 hours in customs and security check for a connecting flight, wasn't even heading to the US",1
Airport,"Because of their pol misses her flight kkr irresponsibly better she gets a free rebooking before I become maseb, if you want to fly to Mexico through another airport.",1
Aquarium,Smells terrible almost everywhere. Put some febreze out there or somethin. There was also no hand soap in the bathroom i went into. Disgusting for the ticket prices.,1
Theme Park,very over priced on everything from ticket which entitles you to maybe a couple rides and about 6 hours of walking unless your into roller coasters.food 11 dollars for a pretzel stick!really! an it was cold an stale.its really all about money now.,1
Airport,"Kind of a shitshow here! Even the TSA line takes 45 mins, very limited food options (Terminal B at least), nobody seems to care about creating any systems that could divert some of the chaos; most workers whether at TSA or food service are just chatting. Could explain the lines ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1
Attraction,"The cancellation policy is so unfriendly.  If someone books 9 months ago, zero changes allowed.  No refunds or changes even if done 8 months advance.  That is shameful.",1
Zoo,Their online system allowed us to buy tickets for 3pm. We showed up and the zoo closed at 3pm. Colored hair staff was rude and unhelpful.,1
Aquarium,Some of the staff was very rude mainly in the gift shop and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place due to the rude staff there the other staff at the exhibit‚Äôs was very friendly but once we got to the gift shop it was another experience for sure,1
Airport,"While going to pick up a group of people, we had to wait at the shuttle for the international terminal to get to the domestic terminal. We are trying to move as efficiently as possible and it is infuriating to have to wait over 15 minutes for a shuttle to come get us. The shuttle driver was not helpful and kept making pointless orders that helped nobody. 0/10 would not recommend. üëéüèª",1
Airport,Probably one of the dirtiest airports I've been to. Needs renovation.,1
Theme Park,Waste of money. They have only few small small rides. But they are expensive. $79.99+ tax per person for nothing.,1
Airport,After 10pm nowhere to eat or drink. Everything is close. Busiest airport? While hundreds of flights still going. Losing money‚Ä¶ I want to get a 24/7 restaurant. I will make bank.,1
Airport,Worse airport I‚Äôve ever been in as far as TSA checkpoints I arrived 2 and a half hours before my flight it was a Fri I arrived 6am I was in airport at 6am flight was departing 8.35am and I missed flight I even had shortcut security n still missed flight what a nightmare 2 HOURS in tsa line what a Frkn joke ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..!!!!!!!,1
Airport,When is the major metropolitan airport going to get a clue regarding cell phone parking lot signage. Tonight all three pickup lanes at terminal 2 we're backed up all the way to the light with people waiting for their passengers. Cops sitting in their vehicles doing nothing to keep people moving.,1
Aquarium,"We wanted to go to the aquarium, but there is only the option to pay by credit card. Our credit card from the Netherlands was not registered as a usable card. Too bad you can&#39;t pay cash",1
Airport,"A very stressful experience.  I‚Äôve been to a lot of airports, and this one is at the bottom of my list.",1
Airport,"Your baggage area and handlers needs new management. Super slow, poor announcements, delayed screens are just the beginning...

I think they walk the bags over",1
Museum,"Travel from California, was not worth it should have stayed home",1
Airport,Steal stuff out of and break my suitcase‚Ä¶. Then make me wait half an hour for the shuttle bus to the car rental center. Wow. You all have fallen a loooooong ways. Total loss of respect. So sad.,1

AZM,Closed for buyout with no information on buyout and a huge middle finger to people who buy a Groupon. Do better. Employees were incredibly rude and didn‚Äôt try to make the situation better. Highly unprofessional!!!!,1
AZM,If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this park to anyone ever. The customer service is a joke. Waste of money to not even been able to get into the park. Drove from Indiana to then have to drive right back home without even getting in the gate.,1
Theme Park,"Our first time! (6 people)  Paid $600 to enter, $25 to get in to park and not a fan of the rude staff! We will
Never be back. Nick that works at the Steam engine Train was the Rudest!!!!",1
Theme Park,The park isn‚Äôt worth how much it costs to get in especially if it‚Äôs only open until 6 pm with some things in the park a bit more difficult to get to than others. Definitely a wasted trip.,1
Attraction,"Overpriced, lackluster, and frustrating for two kids under 7.",1
Theme Park,This place is a disaster!!! Hour wait for a minute long ride. Employees are slow and move at a snails pace. All they seem to care about is if you walk on the grass and stray of their idiotic course that loops you all over the place. Won‚Äôt ever be coming back here. Waste of time go someplace else,1
Theme Park,If you didn't buy reserved rides  they treat you as a s...t.  They taking just reserved rides customers and not taking anyone from line. Not fair. At least they should take half of customers from the line. Can't recommend this park u spend  hours to get on one ride.,1
Aquarium,"A $75 admittance just to see few sharks in the tank, they must be out of their minds. Here is the plot. They shut down all ticket sales on site and tell you to buy online where they push to buy guided tour for a small fortune. No, thank you.",1
Theme Park,Charged my card an extra $100 for the day ticket that‚Äôs absurd,1
Attraction,"Ridiculously FOOD LINES
The food infrastructure is AWFUL üëéüèø. They don‚Äôt allow people to bri g food but they DO NOT HAVE structure. I spend more than 1:40 on a line to get a sandwich. ITS IMPOSSIBLE to have children playing all day long g waiting for almost 2 hours for a sandwich",1
Attraction,"Peak time and lots of attractions are CLOSED! August 20th. EVERYTHING IS AUTOMATED, so good luck getting specific questions answered. No room service as only ONE employee is taking calls. Web site for room service is down and NO HUMANS ANSWER PHONES. Take your family to the beach instead!",1
Airport,Fine airport inside. but after my flight was already delayed arriving here there‚Äôs only one ground crew working? So we end up sitting and waiting for 45 minutes just for our plane to get parked. Awful management to allow this to happen.,1
Attraction,"Sad
For the price of 2 adults 1 child We feel the experience  wasn‚Äôt worth it  Price did not meet the expectations",1
AZM,The food inside is really bad.. The drinks are also really bad. I hope that Disneyland Universal will also come to Korea soon. There is absolutely no intention of revisiting.,1
Airport,"Bad services
I do not recommend",1
Airport,"Horrible, immigration line was 3 miles long, someone puked on the floor and it was never cleaned. After spending 2 hours in line, we had to pick up our own luggage and take it to another area which was not that close. If you can, avoid this airport.",1
Airport,"The Second worst airport,  I have ever been in, the funniest part is their Mayor comes over the loud speaker so proud saying they have the best run most efficient airport in the country, if this is so why cant they handle customs properly, why dont they try to help people that are going to miss their flights, when you ask for help they say its not their problem, too much to explain",1
AZM,"spent $80 for two adults and it took us about 20 mins to see everything. Definitely aimed more towards kids so it might be better if you have children, but i definitely do not recommend for adults. WAY overpriced.",1
Airport,"No where to sit.  The few seats available were taken up by passengers, homeless, Quatar and Delta",1
AZM,"Came down from Montana and drove from TN 3+ hours and more than half of the rides were closed. If more like than half of the rides are closed, don‚Äôt open the park",1
Theme Park,"Extremely poor costumer service. Way over priced , not worth the money, most staff rude and don‚Äôt care , will not come back and will not recommend it.",1
Theme Park,Fans needed for ride lines. Employees are lazy and in no sort of urgency to help guests. Food/drink lines outrageous with only one employee working. Never again. #glorifiedcarnival,1
Theme Park,Do not patronize any place that has bowed down and gave in to this woke cancer.,1
Museum,I used to love Broadway at the beach but it's overpriced and very crowded,1
Airport,"I was surprised, in the ladies restroom near gate B10, an female employee with a UNFI shirt was announcing, ‚Äútips accepted and appreciated‚Äù. First time I‚Äôve seen that in Hartsfield International. Seems like a tip jar or box would have been more appropriate if this is a new policy.",1
Airport,Very rude. Long lines and every coffee shop made the worst drinks. I tried starbucks and peets. Both terrible.,1
Aquarium,I don‚Äôt recommend anyone go there. It‚Äôs expensive for a small aquarium and there were some sea lions which didn‚Äôt seem happy. Don‚Äôt waste your money and time here if you travel to Vancouver.it‚Äôs not worth it.,1
Airport,"Don‚Äôt get your credit cards stolen if you parked in long term parking. Unless you can cough up enough cash to pay to get out. They won‚Äôt bill you and tell you, you are out of luck and can‚Äôt leave with your car.",1
Airport,"Landed early, not enough staff to get us off the plane",1
Attraction,"COMPETE TRASH.
EVERYTHING is automated to take your hard earned cash.

Airport,"Confusing going to departure A and B, not enough signs guide.
You will get lost üòè",1
Museum,"Parking is very challenging, not disability friendly",1

Airport,Very slow customs line. Staff was disorganized and very slow.,1
Theme Park,"Cheap, blah, cashier rude.  Please don't waste your money because it's convient to other things to do.  Much better, less expensive courses a short drive away.",1
Airport,Worst TSA experience! Two thumbs down,1
Theme Park,"Sucked big time
this place sucks big time. All lines are 80+ minutes wait. And I went on a Wednesday. water is $4.99 for a 16oz Dasani. $15 was the least expensive beer. The workers are like all special Ed program workers. All you do is stand on line all day. went Wednesday 8/24/22. Never again",1

Airport,"Landed at 10:18 pm to fly out at 6:15 am.  We walked all over just to get a cup of coffee.. everything is closed.  It‚Äôs 5:30am‚Ä¶no coffee.  
Vending machines are limited and either don‚Äôt take cash or the credit card option doesn‚Äôt work.  Your on their time so be aware.  Just because McDonald‚Äôs/other coffee shops  advertise to be open doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs so‚Ä¶Island time in full effect.",1
Airport,"TSA lines were backed up today, not enough agents working.",1
Museum,the place is amazing but the worker at admissions is so rude for what? asking for a smaller bill and not letting us have a discount because we‚Äôre asian. wow. unbelievable.,1

Museum,"kind of expensive for something of this nature IMO....
took my husband and I about 30ish minutes to walk through... for $75....",1
Airport,Very heavy police presence. Very intimidating.,1
Aquarium,Terrible experience. Some Indian kid with dirty glasses declined my wife‚Äôs bfs military discount and gave us lots of attitude and was very rude. He didn‚Äôt even thank my wife‚Äôs bf for his military service. Wouldn‚Äôt ever spend my money on taking my wife and her bf here again!,1
Airport,"Almost every restaurant closes at 9, and I‚Äôm here with a 3 hour layover. I only had one food option and spent 22 dollars on a bottle of water and the worst Caesar salad I‚Äôve ever had",1
AZM,To much MONEY for a 20 to 30 minute walk through.  High recommend the aquarium at Bass Pro in Springfield It took 3 plus hours to walk through,1
AZM,You pay a membership and they still close for almost the whole season. It has been 2 months since I can't go because they rented or is closed for any other reason. So why am I paying a membership? If is going to be like this is preferable to pay per day. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,1
Theme Park,Came here to pass a good time with family and as we were checking in there was a lady in the front desk who was very judgmental and very rude to my mother and we told her that we understood her and that we are fluent speakers in English so if you are into a negative environment this is your place,1
Theme Park,"Stick with six flags or nickelodeon, this place is horrible",1
Theme Park,"Worst amusement park I've ever been to.  Half the park kept closing for ""weather"" when it's 90 degrees and sunny. Spent 5 hours and couldn't get on one single ride. And ABSOLUTELY NO REFUNDS OR RESCHEDULING. WASTE OF MONEY",1
Theme Park,"Rained for 15 mins and they closed EVERYTHING for three hours, even the food stands! But guess what stayed open, the stores so you can buy junk. Horrible experience",1
Theme Park,"Horrible horrible experience. It was raining and they shut the whole park down. Everyone was super slow and it took forever to get on any rides. Once the rain stopped and the sun was out, they still had shut down all the rides and wouldn‚Äôt have the rides running üò°üò°",1

Theme Park,"Never go with a slightest chance of rain
It began it rain and they shut all the rides down even when the rain stopped it took them close to closing time to open some of the rides . Waste of time and waste of money spending $300 for a trip",1
Theme Park,Parking is a joke. Not because of so many people but the staff who forces you to park out in the further parking lots even though spaces closer are available.  Lot e for people who don‚Äôt know is bf Egypt.,1
Airport,I tried 10 different charging ports and not one works in such a busy airport,1
Airport,It was a very bad and difficult experience at the Atlanta Airport.  Delta cancel my flight at about 2am without warning or advice from Delta. Everything in the Airport is closed at that hour. Even the trains running between the concourses shut down. Not good,1
Theme Park,"Not as nice as it‚Äôs seeing,

Airport,Didn't get a notification of my 8:00 flight being canceled until I was at the airport trying to find my departure gate.,1

Breakfast was so poor
Parks so boring
Last visit for Legoland",1

Airport,FYI travelers and airport employees and flight crew. Zero food support after 10pm. Every single food option is shut down at 10pm zero exceptions. Pretty sad that businesses here don't think they can make money after 10pm. Even though I see lot of passengers and crew members walking around hoping that at least on restaurant could stay open. But nope. ATL FAIL.,1
Airport,It‚Äôs 945 pm not 4 am and you can‚Äôt find any of the stores open for purchasing snacks?  What has happened?  Passengers arrive from all over and if you can‚Äôt find a vending machine that WORKS you are out of luck.,1

AZM,Car got looted in the parking lot.  They stole my wedding ring.  If the place isn't secure everything else is pointless.,1

Airport,"The South Parking area is a dusaster. There is a lot of work going on but the signage on exit and reentry is non existant. Lifts not working. Escalators not working. Stairways locked up.

Museum,Half the things are broken and staff is all ignorant. Definitely waisted my money.,1
Airport,Worst airport in America. The politician that runs this place must be a top moron of America. Seriously. Plan 2.5 hours for domestic and I promise you'll be happy. Very often all the parking lots are full and drop off and pick up are both insane. But only because the people in charge have logic issues.,1

Absolutely hated this
They charged 170 dollars for a small styrophome sword and charged 245 dollars to go down a slide ONCE
this place is garbage

Never wanna come here again

Dont go here",1
AZM,This place is a rip off! I lost less money in Vegas in 30 minutes than in this sorry attempt at a aquarium. It should say Childrens exhibit instead of aquarium as there is more little kids stuff over looking at fish. What a joke. Save your money and go to a real aquarium.,1
Museum,"Noisy, geared for a 5 year old and no informative signs. AC also seemed to be set hot or was broken.  Definitely NOT enough restrooms and those are NOT clean.  Visited quieter and cleaner truck stops. I think from the dragging of tables and whatnot they were setting up for an event of some sort.",1
Theme Park,Way overpriced and the rides are so underwhelming! $19 for popcorn and a water üòÇ‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs expensive and then there‚Äôs outrageous! And this was set before inflation hit so that‚Äôs not it. They are just out of touch.,1
Airport,"My wife was parked here for business trip and figured it wouldn't be a big deal since the shuttles are supposed to come every 20 to 30 minutes. Unfortunately, when she got to the shuttle location she had to wait 45 minutes before a shuttle showed up. This is completely unreasonable and I would never advise parking here unless you don't mind wasting a lot of time.",1

Water park,"Way overpriced food, poor service, can't bring in your own food and drinks.  Bathrooms are filthy and not wheelchair friendly. Wheelchair accessible yes, but very narrow spaces to move through to get to a stall. Stalls are also too small for an average sized adult.",1

Theme Park,The cost to get in was $100. The games cost over $5 each. Not enough Dolly for the dollar. Disappointed,1
Theme Park,Too expensive. $80 for a ticket. $25 to park. $15 for a srink refill cup. Food costs triple what you'd normally pay anywhere else. No more Dollywood for me. They've taken the fun out of it.,1
Airport,"Parking was a fuster cluck. After many flights out of SMF and many other airports, I've never seen anything like it.",1
Airport,Had a horrible run in with a TSA agent on our way out of Minnespolis.  Very poor signage.  Accidentally used a ‚Äúclosed‚Äù terminal.  Green light on.   Conveyor on.  No attendant to show where to go.  Do direction from the person who checked ids.   Berated us and others.  Simple mistake.,1
Airport,"Lady working near conveyor belts, Hispanic, by the name of Munoz on name tag yelled at us for briefly walking towards the scanner that had an out of order sign. We were putting our shoes back on and getting our bearings together. Instead of speaking normal, Munoz yelled at us like she was having her own issues. No one behaving this way should ever work with humans. Go work at the zoo.",1
Airport,"The rental car return signs are few and far between.  The facility is far from the airport and hard to find.  Even rental car employees told me they had trouble finding it when they started work.  Plus, the shuttles also run infrequently. Allow extra time!!!",1
Airport,"Car Rental shuttle is a mess!
The airport itself ain't much better!",1
Airport,My wife is handicapped. I asked for gate to gate assistance and it was a disaster.,1
Airport,This is by far the worst airport ever. It's big and for no good reason. The workers can't even direct you without getting assistance from other employees. I simply needed to get directions after getting off a Southwest plane from Miami to the rental car center. It was a mess and I hate it here.,1
AZM,Workers have been insanely rude both times we have come! First time was literally insane! we decided to try another time still the same! people with bad attitudes should NOT be allowed to work with kids.,1

Garden,I wanted to say instead of putting Cabanas on the beach that we have to pay extra for why not spend that money remodeling the bathrooms. The bathrooms need remodeling badly. Thanks.,1
Aquarium,I wish I could go here all the time. I live about 20 minutes away. I just can't though. It's like Sea World. Whales & dolphins don't belong in bathtubs.,1

Airport,"Absolute trash. It's 8pm on a Friday at the ""busiest"" airport and all the restaurants are closed. I've checked 3 terminals at this point. There's only garbage fast food open. Can America get it together and follow the rest of the world with their airport quality?",1

Theme Park,"The rides are short and they take forever to load and unload. Worst of all, they didn‚Äôt have many food options, and many of them were closed, so we had to wait forever to get food.  Just feels like they aren‚Äôt prepared for the guests. And the park didn‚Äôt feel crowded, so no excuse.",1
Airport,"All decent restaurants closed at 8pm. Will go hungry unless you plan to eat garbage. This is also the worst run, most inefficient, terrible customer experience you can get at an airport. I imagine HELL would be an upgrade. Just flat out terrible.",1

The ones that were open were slow, staffed by surly employees, and overpriced (even by airport standards). I love flying delta, but in future, I‚Äôll do whatever I can to fly through a different Delta hub, like Detroit. Atlanta is a hotbed of hatred, fear, and human anguish.",1

Oh, and the new carry-on scanners are infinitely SLOWER than the old ones. Progress for security theatre.",1

Museum,"Museum does not let you upgrade your ticket after entering, forcing you to buy a membership or miss out, even if you bought online and didn't know.

Museum,I worked here and it was trash!! From actually picking up to staff-trash!!,1
Museum,Very unimpressed for the price. Great for children but to have an adult pay nearly 40 dollars to simply escort your child is robbery. The 1st floor was very interactive and fun but got worse ever floor you traverse. The 3rd floor is all money operated arcade style games.,1

As someone who travels quite a bit and with a busy schedule, I rely on being able to get food at an airport",1
Museum,"(Translated by Google) Very high cost for what you see.

Theme Park,Very disappointed the way they have change Dollywood. Have been a Gold Member for over 15 years. Not sure I'll ever go back.,1
Theme Park,"Terrible process!
Entering at the gate to pay for parking is a nightmare disaster üò´worst process for entering a parking lot ever! They take your money send you forward with no instructions and they go from 7 booths with 14 paying lanes to go out into 2 two lanes of kaous! Never again!",1
Theme Park,"If you plan on eating the country food, plan on a lonnnnngggg wait time. Only 3 restaurants open with 2  1/2-3 hours wait for 2 people.",1
Attraction,I would give it zero stars if i could.  It was so boring. It's mainly for toddlers.  Not many rides and you wait way too long for each boring ride they have. It was a waist of money.  Take the money and go to Disneyland instead.  Will never return!!!,1
Theme Park,"Disappointed
I am not sure how many fast passes they sell but 2/3 of each ride seem to be fast pass.  Regular lines barely move.  Never experienced this before at another park",1
Airport,Parking and police failed to help a disabled woman get to her car‚Ä¶when another car parked illegally. No one who is disabled and doesn‚Äôt feel safe should have to wait more then four hours for someone to do something. Ridiculous!,1
Airport,"Service was not good, the young lady at customer service for southwest had the worst attitude üôÑ",1
Airport,Was my 1st and only time fly frontier. Completely incompetent and inefficient. The only airline that had a 40 minute line just to check a bag. Extra little thing you can possibly think of is an up charge. Worst airline experience I ever had,1
Museum,Proud of the workers here for starting to organize a Union! Power to the people. The only exhibition worth any stars at the Field is the new Native Truths. The rest of the place is corporate propaganda and colonists' lies.,1
Museum,"Over priced food, trash in every corner of the grounds, rude employees, and poor management.",1
Theme Park,The expense and the wait times (especially with a bored kid) make this place unbearable..,1
Airport,I watched a gentleman toss my bag breaking my souvenirs I told him head handle bags with respect and he told me to F off,1
Airport,Terrible signage. Impossible to find where you need to go.,1
Airport,Longest precheck clear line I‚Äôve ever experienced. An hour and 40 minutes from car drop off to exiting security.,1
Airport,Worse airport ever. Worse town ever. Bumper to bumper people and cars. Most rude.,1
Airport,Never see more people care less about your needs.,1
Airport,Reservations were made after our flight was cancelled. We were told that we didn't have any reservations even though we had a confirmation code.,1
Airport,The TSA at this airport are completely incompetent.   I travel to dozens of airports around the country every year without an issue.  I don't understand why there were so many problems at the security check here.,1
Airport,No reason it should take 2 hours to get through a TSA line,1
Theme Park,Too expensive and way too crowded. Not worth it. Used to be better.,1
Airport,Anita at United airlines very rude and not helpful with yelling infront of people no reason threatening to safety and I ask to speak to manger she pretend she is lead at Delta with this attitude I ask another employee for delta manger Anita right away from far yelling that she is the lead and couldn‚Äôt let us finish a sentence really United!!!And no one come as manger to present them.,1
Theme Park,"Not very pleased with Dollywood took a day trip with my family. I don‚Äôt mind paying for things. But $100 to take a handicap person in a park. That they can‚Äôt ride anything or really see anything is totally wrong. 
I would have paid 1/2 price but I feel he was robbed.",1
Aquarium,It's too much confusion just choas everywhere very crowded,1
Museum,Not much to do for our 4 year old. Way way overcrowded. People were almost stepping on eachother. Poor or no supervision from staff. Def not worth what we paid,1
Airport,Worst airport I have ever been to.,1
Airport,"No Starbucks cant find anywhere, the lines are extremely long to check in, then you finally get to the gate try to plug in your phone to charge the battery before you leave for a flight and guess what? none of the seats work that's awesome Great job United!!! üëéüëéüëé Furthermore it's always the very last gate with United Walk for miles to your plane..",1
Airport,So much construction. Very confusing to someone visiting. TSA agent was rude.,1
Theme Park,"I don't like theme parks. Absolute cluster****, waiting in line for anything, everything is overpriced, food is mediocre, just a quinesstial tourist trap with nauseating rides. Also, nowhere in Silver Dollar City can you purchase a real silver dollar.

But hey, if that's your cup of tea go for it.",1
Airport,Where they at???i might be bored‚Ä¶üòÇü§£üòÇ,1
Theme Park,I‚Äôm giving one star to the sweet shop: the girls working there are sooo mean and unprofessional‚Ä¶. I couldn‚Äôt believe the way one of them screamed at us in front of our kids. Just awful.,1
Theme Park,Wow. I can‚Äôt believe silver season pass holders can‚Äôt enter the park after thanksgiving for the 2023 season. Greed at its finest. Pay all of that money for a season pass and can‚Äôt even come in during Christmas.,1
Airport,Flying out today from Atlanta was a complete nightmare! Security check point was 4 lines long. Apparently the workers have experience as prison workers. They are all rude and hateful! I will try to avoid this airport from now on.,1
Aquarium,Wasted our time at the picture checkout. The employees were very mean and racist towards us.,1
Aquarium,Employee are very rude in exit area where you can collect your photos !,1
Airport,One of the slowest airports when it comes to baggage. I have never seen employee's move so slow. I would fire each and everyone of them that work here. Also all of the restaurants are disgusting!,1
Airport,"Big crowds, 3 hour layover on Sunday night, but not even security staff could point out a place to sit down to get a meal.  Almost every place was closed or had a humongous stand-and -wait line.  Just another reason why everyone I know tries to avoid ATL whenever possible.",1
Airport,Terrible food court.  I miss the old food court where you could get your last American meal.  This was super expensive in terminal F and tasted equal to airplane food.  So disappointed,1
Zoo,"I'm 72 yrs old and have been to several great zoos in various places.  This is by far the WORST of them all, and the aquarium was closed. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!",1
Theme Park,This place is absolute joke and money pit. Don't v waste your money or time here.,1
Museum,I was not impressed with it. Kind of like a large arcade. Nothing really great there. It gets over crowded and since there is not a lot to do you wait in line for quite awhile to do anything. Also it is very expensive for what you get.,1
Theme Park,"A star ‚≠êÔ∏è because I like legos. Hotel room smells bad, shower was dirty and more nasty üò∑ stuff. Worst hotel and expensive. Pirate island dinning was dusty. Food is tasteless, dry, not standard. Chefs need to be fired, fired!",1
Theme Park,"If you have an issue, you can forget resolving it. There is NO phone number to call. They‚Äôll change your reservations without telling you anything until the last minute. You better hope you have a place to stay",1
Theme Park,We had to leave early because we tested positive for covid and became ill. They promised to let me finish my trip at another time but never sent the promised voucher. I also can't get anyone there to pick up the phone or call me back. Don't book here!,1
Theme Park,Impossible to talk to anyone in the hotel to inquiry about lost items during a recent stay. The phone number you show in google search goes to a voicemail that it‚Äôs full. Poor customer service.,1
Theme Park,"looked like a fall down don't think anyone would mind if it did
very disappointed",1
Theme Park,The rooms are so small when we booked them never thought about how small they are since they are so expensive.I am talking about really small. Stayed 2 nights thank God we didnt stay there any longer. They children did have fun at legoland but we would have been more comfortable in a regular motel.,1
Theme Park,Horrible rooms. Super tiny for the money. Uncomfortable beds. No microwave in a place where kids and babies will be. I needed to heat a bottle of milk up and had no way to do so.,1
Theme Park,Musty smell in room. The restaurant smells horrible. There is no comparison to the main legoland hotel unfortunately. Regret booking the beach retreat,1
Theme Park,"Room smelled like mold upon arrival.  Took several hours to get another room.  Found mold on Unopened soap in bathroom and on shower curtain.  Room way overpriced for what you get. Definitely not worth the price, even for the room that didn't have mold in it.",1
Theme Park,"Very bad service, you need to stay  more than 3 days minimum, to offer room clean?? Fridge was not working, room was okay, but service really bad and slow!",1
Theme Park,Understaffed and unorganized for the $$ your paying better off staying off site.   In check in line for ever.,1
Theme Park,Ac is broke in room can not get ahold of anyone in the office as well as the mini fridge stopped working after putting kids snacks in and going to Lego land to come back and all yogurts are warm. Do not stay.,1
Theme Park,Horrible service.  It's 4:30 pm and we are scheduled to leave tommorrow and no room service at all.,1
Theme Park,"(Translated by Google) I do not recommend it at all

No lo recomiendo para nada",1
Theme Park,Very disappointed. No food and workers treated the job like a joke. Also rides are more lame than a free carnival.,1
Theme Park,"From Dallas TX worst experience ever , huge park and the line to enter it only has 3 paying booths ridiculous, * short in staff waiting in line for 2 and a ahalf hours just to order a plate of food !! Never again would give negative stars if I could !",1
Theme Park,"Awful service, took me 1 hour to get a pizza, lack of cast members, attractions closed, terrible organisation‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs such a shame for a brand like LEGO  to keep a place like this‚Ä¶",1
Theme Park,"They charge full price for 3 yrs old, but don't have many rides that a 3 yrs old can ride. Must be 42 inches tall. I paid full price for my 3 yrs old but he measure 41 1/2, so he was not allowed. This park is good for 5 yrs old or older.",1
Theme Park,"Huge disappointment, it's a legoland museum with a couple cheap state fair type rides. It's not worth the $450+ price tag. Save your money and go to literally any other theme park.",1
Theme Park,Very unfriendly especially to children with special needs,1
Theme Park,I am trying to reserve a cabana at the Legoland Water park and there is NO DRIECT NUMBER. This is extremely frustrating.,1
Theme Park,"Underwhelming experience overall, from parking to internal functioning is just so underwhelming! Take your kids once and avoid going for a 2nd chance. We visited during Thanksgiving, if possible avoid Thanksgiving and busy Christmas/ end of December.",1
Theme Park,Came here from hours away can‚Äôt ride anything and it‚Äôs not even raining yet üòÇüòÇü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è NEVER AGAIN,1
Theme Park,This company is horrible!! My daughter has the annual pass to get into all the parks and when booking a trip she added the park entry fees by accident and they are saying no refunds. When we call them they say they will transfer us and then hang up. Think twice before booking here,1
Theme Park,"overpriced and not much to see, not to mention the food is gross",1
Theme Park,"I really wanted to give them a zero, but one is the lowest star available here. Our children cried the whole time because not 1 ride was available due to inclement weather PREDICTIONS. The sun shone for at least an hour before it began to sprinkle. Can't believe we drove 6 hours for Legoland!",1
Theme Park,"If someone says that Legoland in Florida is something cool, he has probably never been to other parks, it is trash, it is a rip off, it is",1
Theme Park,"Terrible service, unbelievable waiting times to get food, because there is only one place to buy from. do not go to this place",1
Theme Park,The new season pass holder guidelines are absolutely ridiculous. Dollywood is going to lose so many pass holders. Extremely disappointed. Black out dates for holidays unless upgraded? They don‚Äôt care about their customers anymore. Sad sad day.,1
Theme Park,"After being a season pass holder for years and hearing next year I won‚Äôt be able to go for Christmas unless I upgrade to a gold pass , it will be my first year of not buying them.",1
Airport,"Very bad service! I‚Äôm from San Antonio and this was my first time flying out and the employees are so rude. They don‚Äôt have a friendly and pleasant service from them, they think you should know everything about the airport and where to go. They have smart remarks! Bad",1
Museum,"I know people that read this won‚Äôt listen and will still go anyway, but it‚Äôs very expensive and a lot of the interactive stuff was out of order. The gentleman at the upstairs cafe was super rude. Highly disappointed in this place",1
AZM,(Translated by Google) It was narrower than I expected My middle aged daughter was delighted,1
Airport,The airlines and stores were nice but TSA and TSA pre check we‚Äôre very rude and aggressive,1
Airport,"Food service closes at 9:00 PM, this is super inconvenient if you arrive at 8:50 and your next flight out is at 11:00. Its like they could care less",1
Airport,Thirty minute wait for rental shuttle.,1
Garden,"There is nothing to do or see.There aren't even that many plants if any at all, it was a very mundane experience and not worth the 20 me and my s.o spent. We tried walking around to give the benefit of the doubt but alast there was nothing of interest.",1
Airport,"I had found somebody's wallet in my checked bag. I flew delta. It ¬†was not mine, I reported as soon as I found it. The airlines Delta told me to contact the airport and the airport ¬†told me to drop it off I do not live near the airport. No one was any help.",1
Airport,What a total shit show this place has become. Between the Parking deck Construction and the cross and very rude TSA agents I recommend avoiding this airport at all costs.,1
Airport,TSA personnel need some customer service training. Very rude and condescending. Never knew a sweater/cardigan (the light kind used for layering) was a coat. Customers want their personal effects bins together.,1
Airport,"It‚Äôs a 1 star for me because in the ENTIRE A terminal there are only 5 toilets for all the men. 5 toilets for AN ENTIRE WING OF AN AIRPORT. I almost missed my flight because the line was so long, incredibly bad Atlanta.",1
Airport,"Horrible, the north and south parking is closed they have no signs to let you know this until you‚Äôre already at the lot then sends you to Atlanta west parking which is another 10 minutes from
The airport and the parking is $15 even if you‚Äôre there for 30 minutes! Capitalizing at its best!!!",1
Theme Park,have always had season tickets 7 of them but incase you dont know your regular  silver pass will not get you in from Thanksgiving  until Christmas must have all gold passes they have gotten greedy,1
Attraction,"Needs energy, this park has no excitement or theme. Seems like it hasn‚Äôt been maintained in years.
My daughter got bored in this park, that‚Äôs how bad this park is.
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this park to anyone, waste of money.",1
Theme Park,treating handicap visitors with respect snd making them feel like they aren't welcome,1
Theme Park,will not be renewing with the black out dates! we can't afford to buy 6 kids gold passes. insane you all are doing this!,1
Theme Park,making handicap permitted vehicles pay $25 for parking is so disrespectful. I will not be back. pure greed!,1
Airport,Long waits for food and lots of places closed at 7pm on a Thursday.  Most efficient airport is a joke,1
Theme Park,The park was basically closed. The only thing open was the tram and the gift shop. You would think the person at the front gate would tell a visitor from out of state this but no just charged us $20 and let us find out on or own.  Was a waste of money.,1
Airport,Those parking security people that are in front area where people are picking up and dropping off family need to be taught manners. They are extremely rude to disabled people.,1
AZM,(Translated by Google) Not good for the price (Original),1
Airport,"Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta international airport SUCKS!! Delta terminal and security are ALWAYS backed up, poor communication, rude to customers, delayed flights are the norm. Don't believe them if they say arrive 2 hours early. You need to arrive at least 3 hours ahead. Avoid it like the plague if you can.",1
Airport,It is so hot in this airport. I‚Äôve witnessed multiple people with sweat stains through their clothes. There is no seating for any of the fast food dining and many have to stand because there is also not enough seats for commuters. It is just so hot in here.,1
Airport,The TSA lines were very long and confusing.,1
Theme Park,"Honestly 0 stars this place is great if you enjoy rude staff, over priced on everything!!",1
Airport,Bar none  the worst security set up in every airport I been in. Don‚Äôt believe the tsa wait time. You better double them,1
Museum,"Very poor to see with general ticket, need to pay for everything inside. The worst thing is no toilet for the public. I came with my friends together and separate inside and he had all the tickets. Went out to smoke and then security guy just didn't allow me to enter to use the toilet.",1
Aquarium,"Aging facilities, staff are slow, no healthy food for kids (no fruit, no fresh sandwiches). All the food is American fried food or candy floss.",1
Garden,Oversold for Pumpkins. Car line around the resort and they‚Äôre still selling tickets.,1
Airport,The line to get through TSA check took 1 1/2 hours.  Almost missed my flight.  Only half of the stations were open.  Horrible experience!,1
Theme Park,Paid for 4 adults to enter @ 85.00 per. Then your handicap options were manual wheelchair 27.00 or ELEC wheelchair 85.00. I think that's a horrible price for a rental to enjoy the park.  Very sad.,1
AZM,(Translated by Google) It&#39;s October so it&#39;s very crowded. (Original) It&#39;s October so it&#39;s very crowded..,1

Airport,Incredibly busy with long lines,1
Airport,1.5 hours in security is too long.,1

Airport,"No clear, lots of disgruntled TSA, long lines‚Ä¶..avoid at all cost.",1
Airport,"Long lines, no CLEAR, straight out of the seventies.",1
Airport,One out of two security checkpoints was closed on a Sunday afternoon; I‚Äôve never seen such a long line to get through security. This kind of mismanagement puts travelers at risk of missing their flights.,1
Theme Park,"Felt very disappointing. 6 main attractions not open, could do a lot more choices in merchandise and some main rides were way too short, e.g. driving school.",1
Airport,The very worst airport for TSA pre-check.  Atlanta airport clearly foes not have a protocol for handling TSA pre check.  Every time we wait in line TSA pre check LONGER than regular line.  Horrible. Inefficient,1
Museum,I always buy there alot and one time i weny there and told the guy of the store if he wants to buy me a chocholate for 1 dollar and he said no and i always buy there,1
Airport,"So far the worst airport I‚Äôve ever been to, and it‚Äôs unfortunate because it‚Äôs such a great city. Ghetto, not fabulous!",1
AZM,All of those animals are clearly sad with no hopes of ever having a normal life aside from being alive and taunted by immature humans.,1
Airport,"Security wait at six on a Sunday morning was ridiculous. One and a half hours, easily.",1
Airport,"extremely long lines, they have to have an idea of how many people are coming through their airport, so why can't they make smart decisions and increase security checkpoints and change their system to accommodate their size?",1
Garden,"We came for the Pumpkins show. They don't control how many tickets they sell, the car line was over an hour and they didn't even have anyone controlling the traffic. Put your stuff together.",1

Theme Park,"Horrible, Disappointing
Brick or treat is 3-6 don't go at 930am on a Sunday you will be done with the park by 2pm and your little ones will be exhausted... Paid extra money for brick or treat and didnt even get to go to it!!! Tickets do not say its only 3-6pm!!!",1
Airport,"Long security wait times and the rudest, meanest employees and TSA agents I have ever encountered. Avoid flying out of here at all costs",1

According to the announcements over the PA to many, many people miss their flights.",1
Museum,"Most of the Stars looked like just people not the stars they were supposed to depict.
Overpriced for bad wax look alikes",1
Museum,"Fairly expensive for what is really a collection of incredibly dated attractions.  Also a shocking number of attractions are broken, or just not properly set up.

There are much better places to spend your money in town.",1
Zoo,"Waste of time and moneu
Boo at the zoo was a joke. It was super dark. Had a 7 PM entrance... big mistake because candy was gone or leaving. Too dark to see animals. Just generally a waste of our 140 buck. Oh yeah, our wheelchair broke and they never came to where we were to replace it",1
Theme Park,It's only good if you old no restaurants full selection is horrible,1
Theme Park,Seriously understaffed and the staff that's there lacks adequate training for an amusement park. It's a relatively small park with very little shaded areas.,1
AZM,"They said the last admission is 5pm we reached there before 5 and the employees closed the door and told us we are fully booked because you came late and if we let you in you would take 2 hours inside, then why do you even have a working hours if you are going to close any time you want !!",1
Airport,"The worst staff ever! From the security check ladies that were just chatting and seemed annoyed when I asked them how to go to Domestic, they sent me to a shuttle and the driver was even worse! Too much power trip! Embarrassed to have that airport in Atlanta where so many people of the world goes by there",1
Airport,I have to say the people at the TSA lines are quite rude and not helpful. Not only does it feel like a walmart since usually only a few lines are open even though the have about 20. The people are just unpleasant.,1
Airport,"The TSA Pre line was ridiculous. We stood in line for 30 minutes. Since I‚Äôve been TSA Pre I have NEVER stood in so long a line. Didn‚Äôt have time to buy any airport food so the restaurants lose out.

We were just talking about coming back to Atlanta to see some sights we missed. After the dismal airport experience I‚Äôm not sure I want to come back.",1
Airport,"If you cannot get any food after 5 or 6pm in the busiest airport in the world I cannot provides anymore than 1 star. Horribly dirty most times, especially the bathrooms as well.

Airport,Can‚Äôt believe how early everything shuts down. I guess whoever runs the restaurants doesn‚Äôt like money.,1
Airport,"Airport is usually great but this visit wasn't a great experience. ¬†One of the restrooms you could smell from a mile away. ¬†When trying to leave short term parking, all of the lines are backed up and not moving. ¬†We were in one line and sat for a while and now they close the lane so now we have to fight to move over into another lane...if the lane ever moves",1

AZM,(Translated by Google) Worst theme park.. Recommend never to go (Original),1
AZM,"Not worth. Fishes and other animals were  sick, malnourished, with deformed bodies. Few of the exhibits were in dilapidated state. Not worth visiting and paying hefty ticket.",1

Theme Park,Today the big slides was closed. Every disappointed,1
Airport,This seems to be one of the most poorly planned medium sized airports in the USA. It's in the capital of the state in the forefront of mitigating climate change yet you have to take a carbon spewing tram to car rental facilities. Why not put it within walking distance like lots of other airports?,1
Theme Park,Credit goes to Jesus at front desk for worst customer handling,1

Museum,"Poor
Very disappointed. All yours fully booked. Not much to see and dated. The staff were unfriendly (uncharacteristic for Texas) and unhelpful",1
Theme Park,Make sure you eat.  The food services are mostly shut by 7.   Staff didn‚Äôt have the energy of Disney or universal.    When you hire a bunch of retirees what can you expect,1
Attraction,Why sell the refillable cups if all the refillable stations are closed?,1

Airport,They hire some useless MFers at this place. Whoever is cleaning the bathrooms in Terminal B isn't actually cleaning anything at all. Both Male restrooms smell like an outhouse that's never been emptied. It's so thick and pungent you can taste it. Sacramento is a cesspool and their airport is too. Animals.,1

Theme Park,"We were told we could upgrade our tickets for a season pass for $22 and low and behold after not being able to get back in or get anyone on the phone, we finally went back in and they told us that info was not correct. Pretty crummy. Not worth the money when everything is shut down too.",1
Attraction,"Bait and switch type of tactics with their ""specials.""

Airport,I deplaned on the C concourse and as I got off the moving walkway a brown rat ran right in front of me. I was terrified and felt uncomfortable until I boarded the plane for the next leg of my journey.  There were people around and this didn‚Äôt deter this critter from running around.,1
AZM,most of these animals got chronic depression or something also let people go inside and pet the goats this is literally the only reason i came,1
Museum,The app is not working. Hard to book for tram tours. Bad services,1
Aquarium,So sad.  The penguin enclosure made me beyond sad. The spaces are not adequately setup. The whale tank had a faux tire in it and the penguins had faux rocks that were built into the surface and they were all standing around in singles looking at the ground. It was sad!,1
Airport,There‚Äôs no seats unless you go to your gate! I‚Äôm a pregnant woman and no seats before passing security. Please start putting seats. I have to be here early before going to security and nowhere to seat.,1
Airport,TSA makes being here an absolute miserable experience each and every time. Nothing like being treated like a criminal when you're a citizen by your own.,1
Airport,Horrible. I know security checkpoint is serious business but as I was walking up with my I'd and phone they scolded me to get off my phone. But my phone IS MY BOARDING PASS! Additionally there's probably hundreds of outlets through the terminal majority did not work.,1
Airport,1st flight of my life absolutely horrible from beginning to end. Most of the staff were rude or unhelpful. I‚Äôd rather crawl from SC to AZ in the scorching heat than come back here,1
Airport,"9:55 pm.  Airport jammed.  Over an hour layover.  Not a single vendor, restaurant, bar, coffee place open.  Nothing.  Missed dinner on first flight.  Starving now.  Cookies on plane for dinner.",1
Museum,"A real letdown if you were there before.
Much is gone that once was displayed",1
Theme Park,"Overpriced. The park hours, 11a-5p seem deliberately set so one visit isn‚Äôt enough to see a good portion of the park. In fall, most food places are closed as are, understandably, the water rides. But the price should have reflected these closures and doesn‚Äôt.",1
Theme Park,"$90 entrance fee even for kids that are 3 years old. Half of the rides are closed. Came up to city park circuit ride, they go by age and not by height , makes zero sense. My 4 year old was taller than 95% of the kids going on the ride. 75% of food stands was closed. Never again",1
AZM,"No military discounts, most of the attractions were closed when we got there and they even charged for babies, very disappointed",1
Museum,A lot of the attractions didn't work or were damaged/missing things. One of the racing games in the arcade didn't register my card swipe and I lost money. I don't like how you have to pay to refill the card for the arcade. I did enjoy the 'play until you win' rubber duck claw machine.,1
Airport,"(Translated by Google) As soon as they know that you are Latino, they treat you like a criminal, too much discrimination, the men and women of security terrify you with such voluminous giant bodies (Original) as criminal too much discrimination, the gentlemen and ladies of security terrify with such bulky giant bodies",1
Airport,How do you say ‚Äúsupport the troops‚Äù and was standing in line and a soldier at one of the restaurants asked if they had military discount and they said ‚Äúno‚Äù then laughed at him. Unprofessional and if you‚Äôre going to treat these men and women like that; then change the sign.,1
Airport,Easy to get through and we'll organized ground transportation options.,1
Airport,Maybe it's TSA or the staff here but there is no reason why you should miss a flight after arriving two hours early on a Sunday night because they don't have enough people to get you through security. Typical Atlanta.  Can't wait to move out of here one day,1
Airport,Worst airport ever. If you have a late flight gig are in your own. 100s of people loosing their flight due to TSA and ATL airport. And delta does nothing. Awful airport,1
Airport,"Awful airport, so inconsiderate",1

Airport,"No one here knows what‚Äôs going on. My flight was changed with no notice to me and I had to speak to 4 people before one had any clue how to help. The food is stupid expensive and if you go to McDonald‚Äôs, they‚Äôll get you order wrong and then leave it on the counter to get cold without telling you your order is ready. I fly out of here because I have to.",1
Airport,Being barked at by tsa at 5am just because I forgot to take my bag outta my backpack is not my favorite past time. Treat people with respect. Jesus.,1
Museum,"The pizza at the food court here is a disgrace, eleven dollars for a slice and not only is it uncooked the cheese isn't even properly spread.",1
Theme Park,Sorry to see the changes at dollywood. $25 parking.  Very long walk from the tram to entrance. Also new body scanners even befire you buy your tickets. This is a deak breaker for me. I am not a criminal and should not be treated as such.  Will not be back.  Lost a customer.,1
Airport,Rude TSA agent. Tossed my stuff around during the bag check. Then put half my stuff in another bin. Ridiculous no reason to be so hostile. You give me respect I give you respect. No respect for you. Other staff were very friendly and helpful.,1
Airport,"You really need a person at daily parking lot. We could not find any handicap parking!
Fail!",1
Airport,The new tsa machines are the slowest I've ever seen. This is the most inefficient system I've ever seen in one of our nations busiest airports. Id seriously consider getting my money back.,1
Museum,They had no power when we went and was unable to do anything. Very disappointed when you travel so far to see it. They should have closed it instead of selling tickets to see nothing.,1
AZM,Not many animal any more there and took a lot of things out of the zoo so not worth the money looking at a run down zoo,1

Aquarium,(Translated by Google) nothing to see and expensive (Original),1
Airport,"I am sitting here in the F Concourse, International Terminal, and there are NO filtered bottle filler stations!!! Hello?!? 

This is 2022. No better way for Atlanta to tell the. people of the world: we don't care about the environment and we're slaves to plastic bottle profit.",1
Airport,Awful. No one seemed to know what was going on. Questions weren't answered and getting through security was a nightmare because the employees didn't know what their jobs were or where passengers were supposed to go. The worst airport ever.,1
Airport,"Long lines at security, they did NOT check boarding passes.",1
Aquarium,Poor customer services.. dont know why they have contact number if it just say go to website for everything.. such a waste of time and money..,1
Airport,"Terrible. I‚Äôve traveled extensively and used to live in Atlanta so know the airport.  Over an hour with TSA pre, CLEAR, digital ID, etc‚Ä¶.   General security was over two hours.  Bag check only had half the kiosks staffed.  More reason to avoid flying out of or connecting in Atlanta.  Time to step up as the worlds busiest airport.",1
Theme Park,"Rides shut down!!  BEWARE
We paid over $300 for our family of 4 for admission only to find out all the rides were shut down because of temps below 40 degrees.  I felt we were intentionally misled!",1
Airport,"Nightmare trying to get out of this place. There‚Äôs a north terminal and a south terminal each with an upper and lower level. Uber can‚Äôt pick you up where the other cars pick up arrivals which makes no sense, so you have to walk outside the airport through the parking garage. It took me over an hour to get out of the airport and find my ride share.",1
Museum,Brought my kids there and felt like we just stepped into a gay pride parade. NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY,1
Airport,It's a very narrow and crowded place. Everything is out of date. Smell is bad too. Not many exciting stores. Overall it's a negative impression to me.,1
Airport,"Worst TSA pre and security line in the country!!! Arrogant and rude TSA agents. Chaos is a good description. Sadly, it's a large airport difficult to avoid, but I will think twice before flying here again.",1
Airport,such a horrible airport worst i've ever seen,1
Theme Park,Starting to be rundown. I am an Alabama Country music band family member.  They played there few times. Jeff Cook told me couple times they were treated badly by the staff the park was to small to  Accommodate their group. The out come was unsatisfactory. Parking for fans was  unacceptable.,1
Theme Park,It was cold. Rides shut down. Couldn't find a place to eat that was warm. Lines were long. Left early.,1
Attraction,"I'll never go back. Disneyland is nicer, cleaner. Operators and boat captain have no personalities and no excitement. Workers sitting around not doing anything but looking at their watch. Never again!!",1
Theme Park,"It‚Äôs honestly my fault for buying non-transferable and non-refundable tickets. That being said for a place that gives the appearance of possibly selling out if you don‚Äôt book early, it seems like a requirement.

All I can say is I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt also book at the park‚Äôs hotel.",1
Theme Park,"It' Lego, it's nice. Just waiting times are without end, half of the rides are closed, restaurants are closed and it is missing the charme of the European legolands. Definately not worth the price they are asking..",1
Museum,It was misleading we paid for the tickets and thought it was whole upside down on the inside it turned out it was kids playing area we only took 10 min walk inside and came out without doing anything plus tickets are expensive,1
Museum,"We have been here several times over the years.   This time scram of the actives were either completely broken or down,  or not functioning properly.   This place is a bit run down now.",1

Airport,Horrible cell phone lot traffic flow. ¬†Waited 30 minutes to get out of the lot for a flight arriving just before midnight. Needs to be redesigned!,1
Airport,Delta service desk and airport staff with attitude and rolls eyes when asked a question. Madr me feel embarrassed to ask. Confusing instructions given as my flight was delayed until the next day and unsure whether I needed to check out my luggage. Lots of shuttles connecting to nearby hotel but confusing.,1

Airport,"Airport in general is ok. None of the mobile/laptop charging points in any terminal work. I flew multiple times through various terminals and gates, what is constant is the pathetic state of the charging points. Airport staff and management should be ashamed of it.",1
Airport,Let me just say my experience at this airport was HORRIBLE. The security staff treat people like convicted criminals. The screening process was enough to make me never want to fly this airport again. So if you enjoy being screamed at by a dozen Drill Sargents this might be the airport for you. For those of you with PTSD and anxiety this airport may be very triggering so beware.,1

So very crowded the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. Wait times were outrageous. They sold way too many tickets for one day. Very disappointed with our trip.",1

Airport,Very confusing...staff uncooprative,1
Airport,Almost every single worker inside the stores had a bad ass attitude . They're almost all rude inside this airport. Maybe that's just how y'all get down in Atlanta....

AZM,"Overpriced and crowded! Not worth the money,  anything that wasn't broken or down for maintenance you couldn't get to because of all the people.  Don't waste your money or time.",1
AZM,Over priced will not go back also no local discount was absolutely horrible,1
AZM,"Very crowded,  dirty, overpriced attraction.  Won't be back",1
AZM,"So it's very expensive and half the experiences are out of order if you do not have another adult with you, you can't do any of the rides. It's over rated. Go to the zoo.",1
AZM,"This is the 2nd W.W. I've been to, but the worst one. Several attractions were under renovation or missing. My kid was looking forward to the bed of nails but the bed was gone but the advertisement was still in place.",1
AZM,These people want to charge me full price to go in with my 3 kids even though I'm not playing anything. What a rip off! I walked out I'll never come here again. Do the right thing,1
AZM,The rides are horrible and the lines are ridiculous‚Ä¶ definitely for ages 7-12,1
AZM,Too many interactive things didn‚Äôt work. Not worth the high price. Ripleys next door is much better.,1
AZM,It was fun but definitely not worth over $100 for a family of 3 for about an hour. Half of the stuff didn't work and all of the big attractions that took up space cost extra money. Will not be back!!!,1
AZM,Horrible experience. Too many teens running the rides spending more time talking to coworkers than getting kids through the line. Many of the places inside are not working and broken. Costs to much  money to have that many things not working . Spend your time and money elsewhere.,1
AZM,Over half of the ‚Äúexhibit‚Äôs‚Äù are broken/out of order. We usually love Wonder Works but we‚Äôre very disappointed by our visit on 6/3/2022 and it was definitely not worth the price of admission.,1
AZM,"Wonder works? More like wonder sucks! Everything in the place was broken, don't waste your money!",1
AZM,This place Has more then the others but half of the stuff is broken. Staff has no clue about anything or what‚Äôs going on.,1
AZM,I‚Äôll never recommend to anyone. We paid  70$ For 2 people and nothing was working. The staff at this location don‚Äôt seem to care about anything. The only thing this place has going for it is the view from the outside once you walk in things get worse and worse,1
AZM,Was disappointed in the number of attractions not working,1
AZM,Not worth your money lots of stuff didn‚Äôt work and it‚Äôs not very plus size friendly also not a lot of stuff to do! Don‚Äôt go,1
AZM,I came with a camp and the pizza they gave me was extremely cold. Wasn‚Äôt even humanly possible to eat. I had the meal pass and they gave us this weird pre-made random drink. It was not pleasant. Definitely eat somewhere else‚Ä¶,1
AZM,Employees on ropes course were unreasonable. Very rude. Laser tag is tiny room. Overpriced.,1
AZM,What a rip off. Spent over $150 for half the attractions not to work.,1
AZM,Severely overpriced. And we waited 30 minutes just to buy tickets... $108 for two adults and one kid and many attractions were not functioning. The ones that were working were glitchy and very outdated. Definitely won't be going back here.,1
AZM,"Definitely wasn't a good time. There's a lot of mini rides, but a lot of things were broken! Definitely was NOT a good experience. And NOT WORTH $100 for two adults and a child!",1
AZM,Plenty of exhibits did not work and felt rushed the whole way through. Not worth the price,1
AZM,Nothing to do for kids under 6. Most attractions were broken. Waste of $100,1
AZM,Not as much fun as anticipated. Many things broken or not working.,1
AZM,A lot of the stations weren't working which really sucked! Given the price you'd think they would have everything up and running for the most part.,1
AZM,Will never go there again most of the stuff was closed inside...got the VIP pass just for free popcorn! Way to treat the locals!,1
AZM,"Overpriced. It's just a children's museum and arcade, nothing else. Waist of money, 70$ fir 2 fir 30 min? Claiming obstacles cours timed,10 min. Ridiculous.",1
AZM,I have visitied this place and  and this girl that worked there named Valerie she was at the 3D theater and  completely disrespectful and discarded that me and my family was there and allowed people to come to come ib front of us after we were waiting in line.!!!!,1
AZM,Meh.  Seems a bit worn down and in need of repair and some experiences not working. I wouldn't waste the money,1
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Very expensive for what it has, the experience was boring üòí (Original) Very expensive for what it has, the experience was boring üòí",1
AZM,I did not encounter one thing there that was upside down.,1
AZM,"Waste of money and very overpriced. Very overcrowded, and small Exhibit areas for the amount of people. The 3rd floor is nothing but an arcade while the 1st 2 floors are small exhibits. I would never go back or recommend",1
AZM,I am really not sure how this has many stars. Most rides are broken. Definitely not worth 67 dollars for my son and I. Avoid. Go elsewhere. So dissapointed.,1
AZM,(Translated by Google) design beyond imagination (Original),1
AZM,"Overcrowded, broken machines, basically is an overpriced arcade/ game spot",1
AZM,"Lot of things were broke, definitely not worth the money.",1
AZM,It was not the greatest. Save your money and go to dave n busters.,1
AZM,Let down that arcade games cost money after already paying to get in.....,1
AZM,"HORRIBLE!
Do not waste your time or money. Kids were so excited, just to end up being disappointed. Ac was broken, crowded, elevators took forever (we had a stroller). I also didn‚Äôt see much to do inside for what they‚Äôre charging.",1
AZM,"This used to be one of my favorite spots but at my last visit there was extremely long lines for laser tag, the virtual reality roller coaster & not very many games or activities fully working, no new updates or fixes to the existing broken items. Very disappointing.",1
AZM,Very bad attraction. Things were out of order. Kids didn't even find it entertaining.,1
AZM,"Lameeeeeeeeeeeee waste of money and time and it stinks , horrible for kids",1
AZM,The persons that operator the ropes course are unprofessional.,1
AZM,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVERR , its a waste of money the only good thing about it was the outside view other than that i do notttt recommend it",1
AZM,The outside of the building makes this seem way more fun than it actually is. Definitely a waste of money unless you have kids.,1
AZM,"Worst place ever! Everything was broken, nothing worked. Would never go there again and I would advise others not to waste your money.",1
AZM,"Stay away!
Scam! Stay away from this place how do you spend $36 per adult but it‚Äôs just a bad children‚Äôs museum with an arcade at the top. Over busy and not worth the price. Stay away.",1
AZM,We were told it was for 3 year old age range and not even close. Very disappointed no one at the front desk even told us he couldn't rise any of the rides! Not work the $70 we spent to get in!!!,1
AZM,"Pretty trash, almost everything is closed or dosnt work. Don't waste your money.",1
AZM,Probably 9 different attractions weren't working. Hand sanitizer unit were al.ost all empty,1
AZM,"Ended up being mostly an arcade, not what I was expecting from the description I had read. And many things either didn't work very well or didn't work at all. On top of that, pretty pricey.",1
AZM,Most of the games were out of order and it‚Äôs more of a young kid type environment,1
AZM,The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is bc the lady at the front door didn't tell us the rides would be closed at 7pm until we already paid and could not get are money back,1
AZM,"Their phones, website, and google say they close at 9:00. Worker at the front desk said 7:00. Might want to update the website",1
AZM,It was way too crowded. We waited over 30 minutes to ride each ride. Do not recommend during a peak season unless you have nothing else planned for the day!,1
AZM,Not everything worked... weight limits were false advertising saying up to 300 pounds..but you have to weigh less than that and be smaller than 5 foot 10 in,1
AZM,This was not worth the 98$ we paid!!! There was literally no one at any of the rides and half the stuff didn't work! Wouldn't recommend this place for sure!,1
AZM,Half of the stuff was not working. There was no staff around to the stuff that was working . Felt like a waste of money. Definitely don't waste your time or money here.,1
AZM,This place is a joke. It's far to pricey. And most of the stuff is not working,1
AZM,Stupid expensive! Half of everything was broken. And the Staff was rude!,1
AZM,Most machines and exhibits were closed or broken.  Worst place we have gone during our vacation. Very disappointing üòû,1
AZM,Biggest waste of money in Branson. Don't be fooled by the cool exterior of the building. Half the stuff is broken down or not working right,1
AZM,"Took 30mins to get through admission line.  Purchasing online does not help, have to wait through same line to get a different ticket to scan.",1
AZM,Skip this place and find somewhere else to spend your money. I think it's a place where people use it as an expensive babysitter.,1
AZM,"Long lines, even when you get inside. Many of the rides are broken. Really disappointed, not worth the expensive price of admission.",1
AZM,So this place is just a giant arcade with tons of broken machines even my 4 yr old was bored and didnt really like much of what was there to offer why do i have to pay to get in and then pay more to play things half of what was in there didnt even work,1
AZM,A lot of things were broken or just not attended so couldn‚Äôt go on them.  So many better things in Branson,1
AZM,Disappointed that some attractions were out of order. No food concessions on one floor and some attractions didn't have an attendant.,1
AZM,Too many of the attractions were not working! Such a waste of money!  The one in Orlando is 1000% better,1
AZM,"Waste of money for under 8, most machines didn't work. I dont call watching a TV Interactive. Not again.",1
AZM,Basically for kids.    Weight limits of 225 on all the stuff you are paying to get in for.    Yes this is probably disclosed online somewhere but a total a waste for most adult men,1
AZM,Colossal waste of money. The most interesting & fun part is the tunnel immediately when you enter the attraction. A lot of attractions didn‚Äôt work. Do NOT recommend for kids older than 8‚Ä¶.my 10 YO was bored.,1
AZM,The building looks cool on the outside. But it was too expensive for the entertainment value.,1
AZM,We went and were not impressed. Bought the VIP tickets and didn't get the arcade cards we were supposed to. Also had to wait for 20 minutes each ride wven though we had the vip passes. There was not a lot to do and very little staff around. I definitely won't go back.,1
AZM,Overpriced. The regular ticket price doesn‚Äôt include the tokens for the games‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt take teenagers!!,1
AZM,The price for tickets doesn‚Äôt amount to the experience. Many of the activities/attractions were not working or partly broken. I think there are other better WonderWorks locations. The Branson location is underwhelming and over priced.,1
AZM,Over priced and many of the activities were broken.,1
AZM,"I guess teenagers run the place? Poorly managed, no common courtesy, rude. I was super excited to bring my girls here. I wouldn‚Äôt count this as a Worderworks experience. Spend your money elsewhere and enjoy a WONDERWORKS in a different town.",1
AZM,Went to wonderworks and waited what seemed like forever to get in. We wanted to try the bike that went upside down and they weighed everyone on a scale and announced my weight to everyone. It was humiliating to have to leave the line while everyone was starring. Fun for all ages‚Ä¶ya right.,1
AZM,My granddaughter was there today and an employee stole $100 from her bag in the locker and would not show them the video of the area.  Another employee said this happened last week too. Not a place I would trust to go.,1
AZM,"We go to the counter and the girl was so rude! Management came up and ask her‚Ä¶are you giving people a hard time? He even ask her where her name tag was? She must do this a lot üò≥
She needs a job where she does not speak to customers. I almost walked out.",1
AZM,A lot of the actives didn't work....kinda boring...,1
AZM,"Skip this one. Half the things don‚Äôt work which means the ones that do are packed. Almost 2 hour wait for laser tag, hour wait for climbing wall. Head over to Fritz‚Äôs much better experience in Branson area.",1
AZM,"Under Repair! Not with the money.
5-6 broken exhibits, none with signs indicating they were under repair, and nothing communicated at time of purchase. Manager seemed indifferent and blew us off. Really disappointing.",1
AZM,"Not worth it
Not for adults. Lots of exhibits didn‚Äôt work which was disappointing. Would be a great place for kids, but don‚Äôt recommend for adults couples. It‚Äôs more of an arcade.",1
AZM,"Waste of time
Save your money, only half the exhibits are open, half are broke, long lines‚Ä¶.they are understaffed and not polite",1
Theme Park,Area 3 Legoland workers are very lack in focus & the managers are not doing their jobs instead they‚Äôre to busy trying to get nasty in the bathrooms and ride closets with other mc workers . Also putting workers who date each other at rides which they lack in focus for that exact reason .,1
Airport,TSA pre-check signs in Terminal A Security are terrible and not easily visible. FIX IT!!!,1
Airport,What the heck happened to this airport? The area near Burger King looks like a Zombie movie set.,1
Theme Park,"Unless you like cheek-to-jowel crowds, you might not enjoy S.D.C. There are positives, but they aren't worth fighting the crowds to do/see, IMO.",1
Theme Park,People who parked in handicapped section were not picked up by tram. Had to walk 1/4 mile to entrance. Handicapped parking lot has been moved farther from entrance. Not enough food places for the number of people in park. 1 1/2 wait for sit down meal.,1
AZM,Had plenty of spots open and would not let anyone park.,1
Airport,Got into bradley 15 minutes early and the plane couldn't pull up to a gate.  Frontier. The gate was still occupied.  So we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac and WAIT   for a spot.  We have been waiting now for 30 minutes on the plane on the tarmac!!  Ridiculous,1
Airport,Long lines to ck bag at SW and long long long wait through security even with clear and at 5 am.,1
Aquarium,Far too crowded. In the end you have to choose between waiting forever to find an opening to squeeze near the glass walls or resign to only see the less popular exhibits. All for a pretty expensive ticket. Never again.,1
Aquarium,"$20 admission in state; $44 admission out of state!   We were looking forward to an afternoon at the aquarium, but apparently it is only for locals.    This wasn't like this when I lived in Chicago.",1
Garden,"I am very disappointed with the customer service. I had 3 different unpleasant and unhelpful interactions with 3 different workers. No one was willing to give friendly directions. It was as if me and my husband were in the way, not as if we were paying customers.",1
Airport,Rude staff and outdated seating in the terminal.,1
Airport,"Very unorganized airport I ever seen in my life , waited 2:30 hours to get clear the immigration process by the check out . Another wait was on the parking exit .",1
Airport,"The airport don‚Äôt pay attention to Baggage Claim Lines: December 12, DL1075 from San Francisco was announced on line 7 for Baggage Claim, but the luggage‚Äôs are coming on lane 6! I‚Äôm waiting all the time for luggage‚Äôs until no one is coming and started to look around. As I asked I was advised to line 7!? Very disappointed.",1
Airport,"Horrible. Too large & crowded.
Hundreds of people in line for passport control had maybe 6 or 8 open booths. Just getting around the place is a chore. Bigger isn't always better.",1
Airport,"Worst airport in the country. TSA is annoying but at SMF is something else. My strong suspicion is that there is some back alley deal between TSA and Clear Secure, Inc. Someone is definitely getting payed to make the TSA process as bad as possible in order to push clear services on travelers.",1
AZM,"This place is very expensive.  So, we didn't purchase the tickets. Something should be done about the prices. Even the online prices are too much!",1
Airport,Staff was rude with the airport just opening. Would not want to be here later in the day. Dirty and not kept.,1
Theme Park,Way too expensive and crowded for such a small amusement park.,1
Theme Park,Our family of five has held season passes for over 10 years. Now we find out season passes are no longer season passes? Highly disappointing.,1
Theme Park,Our family of five has held season passes for over 10 years. Now we find out season passes are no longer season passes? Highly disappointing.,1
Airport,TSA rude as always and not enough of them.,1
Airport,"Came to airport at 4 am  two hours before the  flight; spent 1 hour and a half in line to pass the TSA. Not enough agents at checkpoints. Everyone is unhappy and mean. Very bad organize  and has zero customer service. You do know how many flights will be going out, so you do know how many people will have to be checked‚Äîno excuses for not having enough agents.",1
Museum,"If you have kids, spend your money somewhere else. Nothing interactive in the Wax Museum, just picture taking with wax figures who semi-resemble Hollywood stars. $125 for a family of 4 is simply nonsense for what it actually is.",1
Zoo,Overpriced and doesn't have that many animals to see.,1
Airport,Worst car rental and shuttle service I have seen at any airport in the US! Terrible! Slow. They don't care about customers. Also bad food options inside.,1
AZM,"VERY RUDE AND STRAIGHT MISERABLE STAFF! I never leave bad reviews but we got treated awful here. complete waste of money, better off going around the corner to the trampoline park at least they smile and know how to treat people √∞≈∏¬§¬∑√¢‚Ç¨¬ç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Ç¨√Ø¬∏¬è",1
AZM,"What a joke! Don't expect to be able to do anything you pay for, because they're under staffed. When I asked why I wasn't told before, well it didn't seem important. Over $100 to do what?",1
AZM,This place was joke. My kids and my wife and myself had the place to ourselves and I understand why there was no one else there. Only half the attractions worked the staff were no pleasant people. We went for my sons 5th birhday and It was the biggest mistake. DO NOT GO!!!,1

Garden,If you're expecting actual Christmas lights don't come here. Waste of money and time. Half the areas were blocked off,1
Airport,"Traffic stinks, everything is setup to herd cattle.  Only good thing is being able to park in hourly lot and stay out of rain if weather is so inclined.",1
Airport,"Rude, racist and arrogant white passengers terrorizing black women airport employees. I assumed some of these racists fly in or are racist locals who hate seeing black people as employees in a busy international airport.

AZM,Went to see the Christmas lights .. overpaid last year was so much better.  Not enough lights this year,1
Airport,"Painful!!
A member of staff set off an alert on one of the doors to an air bridge at gate F3A.  This resulted in a flashing light and a vicious siren that was uncomfortable for everyone waiting in the surrounding 4 or 5 gate areas.  It took nearly fifteen painful minutes for the 'world's most efficient airport' (is this a joke?) to switch it off!",1
Garden,What a horrible start for a family Christmas vacation. Cottage was not ready at regular check in time. All we were told ‚ÄúSorry we are short staffed so you will just have to wait‚Äù. We had small children with us‚Äîtired hungry and not happy. CRG you didn‚Äôt make a very good first impression.,1
Airport,I would give lower stars to this airport due to over cramped areas and extremely low number of seats available near boarding gates. People sitting and sleeping on floor waiting for their flights. Please add more seating arrangements or expand the zone,1
Airport,"This is a poorly managed and executed terminal, especially the food court. I've been through this terminal four times in the last 2 months.

Theme Park,"Used to be our favorite family vacation spot, but has gone really downhill. The worse part was finding out the tree only lights up once a night. Such a shame.",1
Airport,Worst airport. Doesn't matter where you stop ie. Restaurant/gift shop all workers are disrespectful worthless POSs,1
Theme Park,Last year with their BS COVID reservations and them forcing masks on everyone.  This year with their silver pass blackout dates.  Dollywood is continuing to disappoint.  I won‚Äôt be buying season passes this year!,1
Aquarium,"Buying tickets was so frustrating, and the lack of human beings to answer the phone & help, had us go elsewhere. ¬†Group sales just sends you to Nicole's voicemail rather than to anyone that's going to help. ¬†I hope they care for the animals better than they do people.",1

Museum,not all of your exhibits/activities were even working...very disappointed,1
Museum,Overpriced. Paid $90 for 3 people with a military discount. Half the stuff was broken and not working. Probably should tell ur customers this before they pay for entry. Not worth it at all. Not good for toddlers.,1
Museum,you should limit the number of people you allow in this!!! we had 10People and paid mad money and it was packed. so packedWe only stayed about an hour. Didn‚Äôt do any activities. To many people in line. I wish they would of told us. we wasted over 300 bucks.,1
Airport,Three hour wait for travellers who had to go through passport control. Unacceptable.,1
AZM,"Do not recommend at all for many, many reasons. Run down, not much to see, poor safety regulations and so many more reasons to not waste your time going.",1
Airport,"The star is only for the kind, helpful and courteous shuttle bus driver. Airport authority needs to ask their vendor to add more buses, one for each lot - East, West, and Daily Lot.

Aquarium,While trying to reserve shows on my phone I was yelled at by 2 individuals accusing me of taking pictures of Santa that I was not taking. After showing them my gallery and no Santa pictures. They threatened to call security on me for being rude. I drove 12 hours to deal with rude employees.,1

AZM,"Very misleading , very pricey,and not worth the money . There are probably better attractions that are cheaper.",1
AZM,Too much to spend for several things to not be working. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend,1
AZM,Here now. Most of the attractions are broken or closed. $150 for 30 mins and kids are ready to leave. Waste of money!,1
AZM,Definitely was not worth the money we spent to visit. Several of the exhibits did not work properly or were referenced but missing! The staff on the skywalk area was incredibly rude with my husband when my son became frightened. We were very disappointed!,1
Zoo,It‚Äôs not worth more than $5. Minimal things to see overall. We went with a group of 8 and everybody was thoroughly disappointed. Santa didn‚Äôt even talk to us. He just said ‚Äúnext person‚Äù like a machine. Would never come back or recommend to anyone.,1
Airport,Don‚Äôt fly in past midnight‚Ä¶ shift change means a 2 hour wait for bags with zero help. Possibly one of the worst airport to fly in with checked bags.,1

Airport,"Worst airport I've ever used. Unintuitive, slow, and unaccommodating.",1
AZM,"You might fool some people, but most of us will never forget what you did to Harambe.",1
Airport,Never in my life seen a TSA Precheck Operational hours. A lot of people plan their trip around having access the the perks of Pre check not to mention we pay for it so why are there operational hours? With no notice. Might as well not purchase precheck then,1
Theme Park,Had to wait in line for 45 minutes to get thorough the parking tollbooth even though I had free parking with my pass. These idiots that run this park do not have 2 separate sections for people paying for parking and people with parking passes.,1
Airport,"This is what I imagine hell looks like, hate this airport. Security check takes forever, airport staff is useless, and everything is spaced too far apart from gates to rental car area, terrible design.",1
Theme Park,did not find it worth the cost. we saw one show. ate an expensive lunch. rode the train and while expecting to see lots of Christmas lights instead saw lots of construction. just not worth the cost of parking and tickets.,1

Garden,"We asked for refund when we canceled. They refused regardless of details.
Refund our reservation money due to storm. We live 1-2 hours away and the very cold, snowed, windy storm was to arrive when we were scheduled to be at the Botanic Gardens.",1

Airport,"For the amount of snow they get, you would think they're efficient at keeping the runways open and the planes moving. But everytime it snows it's like their first time. Terrible.",1

Airport,"They spent all that money to renovate the pickup/dropoff area but somehow it's even worse? And you have to walk a mile to get to the rodeshare zone, only to be harassed by private drivers. This is only one of many complaints. Truly one of the worst of the big airports.",1

AZM,Here for an employee event and was waiting in cold with a baby. There was lack of empathy shown just business as usual. We won't be back.,1

AZM,"The zoo is very dirty. I saw garbage all around the grounds.
We took our family from out of town, expecting a great experience considering the ticket price was over $40.
I can‚Äôt think of anything good to say about our trip to the zoo.",1
Theme Park,It was not my favorite place especially for the price. Park is dirty and the Staff is extremely rude. Will not be going back again.,1
Theme Park,Very expensive! Was not interested in legoland but you can't just go to the gardens. There should be a separate admission just for the gardens. We left without seeing them.,1
Theme Park,"Was highly highly disappointed. For a one night stay and over 400, I expected so much more. Legoland truly let me down. If you want a nice room, go to The Gaylord, where it‚Äôll be cheaper with valet parking, and so many more amenities.",1
Airport,"The biggest airport in the US and the biggest FAILURE as well.... 3 Immigration officers for a never ending line and passing security for connections doesnt get any better, only one scanner!! This is definitely worse than  a third world country airport. Awful",1
Airport,"No food is available after 9:30. For someone who has been traveling all day, makes for very hungry, unhappy passengers.",1
Airport,One of the worst airports I have ever been in,1
Theme Park,First time going with the family an last I wouldn't recommend,1
Airport,This is my least favorite airport in the States. It takes 2.5 hours from the arrival time at the airport to actually get to the gate for your flight. Very easy to miss a flight here. TSA is always slow EVEN in the Clear or TSA pre-check lines. The signage and directions are terrible and a lot of the people that work there are rude.,1

Airport,The only airport where the TSA pre-check line takes 25 minutes and the regular takes seven.,1
Airport,What an absolute dump. I felt like I was in a zoo with wild animals.,1
Airport,"Is this a maze or an airport? Why is everything so far apart? If you have to rush from one concourse to another, or from one end of a concourse to the other end for that matter‚Ä¶. I hope you don‚Äôt have a tight connection.",1
Airport,There is no where to get comfortable when the airlines screw you and leave you setting for 12 hrs! Thanks delta,1
Attraction,"Absolutely awful. Almost all the rides were closed, restaurants closed, there was garbage everywhere and it's just a bunch of playgrounds and carnival games. Likely the last time we'll be coming here!",1
Museum,Not much to see or do.  People cutting lines for simulator and workers don't say anything. Lines are not managed.  It's a waste. Have to wait in one line even if you purchased or didn't purchase tickets online. Items are over priced. Will never visit here again. Waste of money and time.  üóë,1
Airport,One of the worst airport and you should be ashamed of yourself for calling number one airport without enough carts for luggage. It took almost one hour to get a cart.,1

Please think many times if you going to go in winter 90% of attraction is closed",1
Theme Park,20 for parking! 40 for a ticket. Definitely not worth it,1

Airport,"International airport that operates like a regional. Food services close early, usb chargers that don‚Äôt work and no more smoking areas inside. People often can spend several hours between flights. It‚Äôs ridiculous that you have to go outside and back through the security checkpoints for a smoke on a layover, especially considering how long the checkpoint lines are!!!",1
AZM,"Great activities but sadly not everything was working. It's expensive, especially considering that we found out after we paid and entered, that the 4D theater, Helicopter simulator, maxflight, laser tag, and 360 bike weren't working. Ask if everything is working prior to purchasing tickets.",1
Airport,Dirty and the airport employees are ghetto. Rude food workers and slow and the seating areas are dirty.,1
Theme Park,"I would spend my money at Disney
The rooms were dirty.  No way to call the front desk except from the room.  Worst of all was the lack of knowledge from staff.  Food was horrible!!!",1
Theme Park,It's the worst place to visit on earth. Don't ever go in the summer time.,1
Airport,It's ridiculous that there's one bus for the daily lot but 15 busses for rental cars. Absolutely the worst customer care. My only guess is that they are trying to collect extra money from the parking fee by making us wait for next Christmas. I'd preferred to rate with zero stars.,1
Aquarium,This place is a dump! The Dolphin show was the worst I‚Äôve ever seen. Then when we wanted to have a snack to eat we had to sit ON THE FLOOR!!! This place had no seating for patrons who want to sit and eat!!,1
Museum,"Staff so rude and unprofessional. The so called famous Tram tour is a joke, they just take you to see those boring old buildings. They also charge you 7 dollars for bag storage since they suspect everyone for stealing stuff from them",1
Museum,"They wrote on their website that it was free entrance that day, turns out they missed to add that it was only free for Illinois residents.",1
AZM,WHAT A JOKE. My husband and I bought tickets online but were refused entry because we didn't have a child with us. We're from Australia and he loves lego so we thought it would be something to do while it was raining. Nice $50 wasted.,1
Aquarium,"This place horrible! Terribly over crowded, can‚Äôt enjoy anything because there were too many people! The Dolphin show was just terrible.

It should be rename  because it's A Hall Of Shame",1
Aquarium,They are screwing over the walk-in patrons. I was told the next time I could enter was three hours after the time i arrived. They then charged me a full day ticket when I was only allowed less than 5 hours. They are getting too greedy.,1
Airport,"The security line is ridiculously long, the airport needs to work on there ways of getting people through security. I‚Äôm sure many people agree with me. Today I was flying and got there in plenty of time to go through security. ( 3 hours ahead). The security line was all the way in the parking ramp! Like seriously MSP??",1
Attraction,"Park not fun
A lot of rides were closed, and food spots. No workers could be found to help. And no Lego people out for pictures. This was not fun at all.",1
Aquarium,Bring back the real dolphin show! Kids were literally crying because all they saw was a penguin for 5 minutes.  Be aware it‚Äôs not like the old days.  The old show was literally the BEST part!  Bring it back please! We did not renew our membership because of this change.,1
Museum,"I've been here multiple times, but this time was awful. Half the attractions were broken, and the attractions that weren't broken, were overwhelmed with the amount of people trying to participate. $60+ for nothing.",1

Airport,Had to walk over a mile to go through customs because we got dropped off at E terminal and then had to put up with customs because last time I brought some prosciutto ham now I'm getting pulled over to have my luggage checked every time I travel to other countries .

Aquarium,"I enjoyed my visit to the aquarium but the photo people at the beginning and end were very rude and hostile in insisting that I take a photograph when I don't feel comfortable doing so. When I asked to talk to the manager, Nadia was equally rude to me.",1
Airport,Overly busy. Rude inefficient employees. Nothing is open after 9 pm. No vending in the baggage claim area. Nowhere to sit in the atrium. Someone meeting someone that's on a later arriving flight might want to get a cup of coffee but alas they can't. Honestly probably will make the 2 hour drive to Greeneville in the future.,1
Airport,"My God, what a disaster this place is. I thought NYC airports were bad but geeeez.
Lines, no staff, noone knows anything",1
Airport,"Already started removing chash.
How you can see from the photos, no chash on many places, just credit cards, and mobile payments.
And still masks are required to enter restaurants.
And no weapons in an airport, what is strictly forbidden to pass through TSA check points anyway.",1
Airport,"The worst f%#&ing airport I have ever been. The TSA staff thought I was a non American and made derogatory comments toward me several times, thinking I didn‚Äôt understand English.  Absolutely unacceptable system and behavior by staff. I will avoid this airport in the future. üò∞ü§¨",1

AZM,Way to many people in there at one time. It's definitely not worth the money.,1
Airport,Only 2 TSA employees for a ton of people. Worst airport and service.,1
Aquarium,"Too expensive and too crowded.
Tickets for 4 adults and 1 child were $188.00. Got there at 10 am on a Sunday and by the time we were leaving the place was completely full. Some people may enjoy leaning around others to see exhibits but it was too much for me.",1
Attraction,"Dirty restrooms, bad upkeep, awful food, so-so customer service, and not very entertaining. Save your money or go to another amusement park.",1
Attraction,"Paper thin hotel walls
Hotel themes are awesome. Our son loved the knight themed hotel, but the walls are so thin you can hear everything. Trying to sleep was next to impossible. We expected kids to run around but we can clearly hear conversations from the rooms next to us.",1
Airport,The dirtiest airport I have ever been in and are NOT friendly at all. Stay clear of this one when traveling,1
Aquarium,$63 for 1 adult and a 4 year old. Took us 1 hour and 15 minutes to go through. Not to mention the idiotic policy of having to have an entry time. Will not go back and certainly will not encourage anyone else to go.,1

Airport,"Half decent food options are all at A Terminal - plan accordingly if you are flying out of F.  Car rental drop off, then shuttle to the terminal takes 45 minutes - plan accordingly. Basically, just a poorly laid out airport compared to others of the same size.",1
AZM,"For travelers, IGNORE THE WEBSITE! They do not accept reciprocal memberships so buy your tickets online. Following website instructions, getting tickets at the zoo means, you are paying full on-site prices.""",1
Airport,Worst airport ever as far as TSA security goes. Never said to take out tablet from her purse all other airports says not to so she left it in her purse. The guy goes into her purse unobserved by my wife and puts it into a bin separate from the main one and never told her causing her to leave it behind causing her to be very upset while on vacation.,1

AZM,It cost almost 200 for 5 people and 90 precent of the things to do was shut down with no worker so u can't do it. If u have kids under 5 it's grate but not much for teens when they have age appropriate shut down,1
Theme Park,"I was attended by an employee who spoke in Spanish, after the service an employee was speaking badly and making fun of my family, thinking that we did not understand or speak English.  This is preconception.",1
Museum,Power went off as soon as we got in. Most machines didn't work. There's no way this place is worth what you pay.,1
Aquarium,I was definitely underwhelmed. Tickets were about $50 person and definitely over priced. There was an awful smell throughout the entire building. Overly crowded and traffic in the parking garage. I wouldn't come back here.,1
Aquarium,There is Zero capacity management in the last few years. Impossible to enjoy with thousands of hot bodies.,1

Aquarium,Order way ahead and hopefully cheaper? Stand in a line outside in the cold... Yeah no thanks.,1
AZM,"1. Not so much excited after visiting Georgia aquarium in Atlanta earlier

2. Scope for improvement.

3. V. Expensive.

4. Has extra charges to other facilities like glass boat, Snorkling etc.,

5. Will not recommend for the fee charged.",1
Aquarium,This place is not worth the price for people who live out of Illinois. I recommend doing something else. Boring. Nothing super amazing,1
Airport,I never have to wait 2 hrs on a rideshare zone this weekend was outrageous traffic was terrible the small buses needed to be out of there,1
Aquarium,Way too crowded.  Felt like Disney world.  And the traffic was horrible.  Wouldn't go again sadly.,1

Airport,Taxi dispatch is entirely dysfunctional. ¬†Never improves. ¬†Terrible system. ¬†Disgrace to JFK,1
Airport,"The quality of terminal 4 has gotten consistently worse over the years. ¬†I've been waiting at the baggage pick up for 1.5 hours with no sign of my luggage. Additionally, the time it takes to get from the gate to the baggage pick up is atrocious. ¬†By the time I get to the baggage pick up, I'm sweating and I've probably walked 10k steps.",1
Airport,"This terminal has absolutely the worst workers. Unfriendly, rude and just overall bad attitudes. If this was my business I'd fire them all. Life is too short to be miserable. If you hate your job, quit. There are plenty more out there. Don't make everyone else miserable just because you are.",1
Airport,"Terrible place for before security. No places to sit at all, and why... we had an 8 am flight and had an 8 hour layover, check in was at 3-4 amNo places to sit",1
Airport,They are the rudest people ever and think they own the airport making you move out of the way even though people were not near their kiosk.,1
Airport,Always a disaster. Bags never come out in less than 30 minutes. No other airport is this slow.,1
Aquarium,RACISTS! Discriminated against me upon arrival and was subject to secondary screening. 0 stars!,1
Airport,Literally sitting on a plane at the gate and the jet bridge froze over night. Pilot tells everyone there is a manual override key needed to move the jet bridge and let the plane move. Some dummy employee of Bradley Airport has the key needed and is not at the airport. What kind of ridiculous operation are you running Bradley Airport?,1
Aquarium,The events manager Riddhima is extremely rude and condescending. She also avoids emails and returning phone calls unless she is called out to other staff.,1
Aquarium,"Went during the week to enjoy a less busy day at the shed, they decided to let anyone from Illinois in for free with a pulse and it was a terrible experience. Likely won‚Äôt waste my time being charged full price for a free crowd.",1
Airport,GA must be broke.  This airport is always EXTREMELY hot.  As many people that are in this airport and dress for the outside weather you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be smart enough to correct the temperature.  It‚Äôs ridiculous.  There are a lot of retailers with such attitudes no matter how much you smile at them.  Hate this airport,1

Airport,"One of the Frontier staff members was extremely unprofessional and Rude to every frontier passenger.

Thankfully, another frontier staff member cleared a few of us without needing to pay.",1
Airport,Is anyone else tired of seeing dozens of open spots from just the road in Economy South when it's CLOSED! Please stop closing the parking lots! Let people risk it and look! Forcing people to park in more expensive lots is corrupt and criminal! Someone w some ethics and a brain needs to step up.,1

Airport,"Gate attendant at d1 is rude af
Just stopped talking to me after not being able to give me a straight answer while she was on a personal call in her left ear...just cold",1
Airport,TSA agents and airline check-in agents are rude and nasty. We're calling laptops fire hazards to aircraft. The Atlanta airport is disorganized chaos and not deserving of even one star.

Airport,Clearing security took an hour even WITH Clear and TSA precheck...,1
Airport,"Every time I've been threw this airport I've always encountered delays.. so I'm not sure the mayors definition of ""efficient"" is but it's not the airport.",1

Garden,Definitely don't waste your time in winter time (including March).,1

Aquarium,"I can only imagine that the wonderful reviews are from people who haven‚Äôt been to a better aquarium. This aquarium is geared toward children and does not have much for adults. Next time, I will drive the 3 hours to Baltimore.",1

AZM,"I'm from Kansas City, MO our Aquarium is a thousand times better than Aquarium at the Boardwalk in Branson I don't think I'll be returning because the experience and the cost didn't add up. I would recommend the Ripley's and Ripley's fun house combo.",1

Aquarium,"Smaller than I expected and for the price, getting through it in an hour was not worth the drive from Columbia to see it.",1
Museum,"Disappointed.
Pretty much a waste of money & huge disappointment. Maybe if we had been able to do the tram tour, I‚Äôd feel differently.  After going to cape canaveral, Houston was a big letdown. I would not recommend, nor waste my money to see a few displays and a movie of film clips.",1
Museum,It is not the best or the worst wax museum I've been to. It was decent.,1

AZM,(Translated by Google) Tickets are expensive and there are few things to watch The toilet is dirty and the surrounding is noisy (Original) Tickets are expensive and there are few things to watch The toilet is dirty and the surrounding is noisy (Original),1
Airport,This is ridiculous! The line for TSA is the length of the building and curves back around. So much for needing to be here only 1hr ahead of time for a domestic flight. You need at least 3 to get through this line.,1
Airport,"On the plane starving because the lines were too long to purchase food. No seats left at gate. Airport clearly cannot support passengers flying to or out of ATL
Also, bathroom lines were crazy",1
Airport,"Every restuaraunt in ATL takes 30-45 minutes on a fast day. my least favorite airport worldwide.

anything you buy at this airport tastes like a garbage version of whatever the franchise should be.",1

Aquarium,"Employees are rude. Food over priced and no boxes for leftovers. Limited shows, may not arrive 2min late. No Go.",1
Theme Park,The prices are way yo high the season passes and food,1
AZM,Everything was overcrowded and most Everything was broken. People acted with no sense there. Terrible,1
Airport,"Ground and deicing crews took well over 2 hours to load bags and deice the plane, with all passengers trapped inside. This more than doubled the amount of time spent in the plane.",1
Airport,The worst airport in the country!! Everyone has an attitude. Maybe it's an Atlanta thing I don't know,1
AZM,"Some of the employees have some serious racial hate towards white people. Hard to explain to a 6 yo why people hate you because of your skin color. I tried to file a complaint but unfortunately their was no one available.  Terrible experience,  will never ever come back.",1
Aquarium,35 for a ticket to come to CAMDEN IS INSANE. Putting your family at risk for what?,1
Garden,"Terrible customer service. The cabins are old, the decorations is outdated, but sadly the accountability from management is nonexistent. I would not recommend this place at all. There are other places that look much better as you drive around.",1
Theme Park,"Boycott Tenn.
Like Dollywood, but I will no longer give my money to a state that is hate filled and insist on taking our rights away! Boycott   Tenn., it's just not safe!",1
Museum,Terrible. At least 50% of the exhibits were non-working. This dumpster fire owes me 50% of my money back. There many other are actions that coat less and are more entertaining.,1
Aquarium,Wow that was a waste of money!  7min dolphin show! What a joke! Crazy crowds. Dirty restrooms and tables in the cafe. Horrible. Spend your money elsewhere.,1
Airport,Busy ......... If you want to get cussed out by a underpaid employee. Is anywhere in this airport work. You can start with security,1
AZM,Such a ripoff.  So many activities were broken.  Would never go again.  We were out in 15 minutes.,1
Aquarium,"Rotten.
Rotten experience.  Way too crowded and filthy.  Employees yelled at you to keep moving.  You couldn't.",1
Aquarium,"Barely an aquarium.... tiny with barely anything actually living to see. Unless you have a toddler looking for hands on displays it's a waste of time. Also I want to add that even if the turtle area is for turtle ""rehabilitation"" the tanks were the size of a small hot tub.",1
Airport,The McDonalds of airports. This would completely deter me from flying again.,1
Attraction,Nothing like being there for 6 hours and only being able to go on 4 rides. The lines were ridiculous and having young ones waiting that long is unrealistic. Make people have to spend another $100 to get the line cutting pass after already having spent $421 is the Legoland solution...never again.,1
Museum,"Regret
So crowded. Ridiculous lines for the real attractions. No apparent limits on sakes. So good luck. Been waiting over an hour for the ropes course. They should at least let you know the wait time based on line size. Not. Worth. It.",1
Theme Park,"If you're 6 foot 3 or taller expect to not fit in several rides. App was wrong about which rides are open. Overall disappointing, especially with all the other options nearby.",1
Attraction,"Traffic was awful, took 40 minutes to enter them park. The lines through security were back up for two blocks. Once we entered the lines to rides were 40 minutes  to 90 minutes to go on a single ride. They were understaffed ,boats sitting empty with no staff to speed up the wait.",1
AZM,Shame on you for not letting visitors know due to weather hardly any of the animals would be out. College student on spring break spent hard earned money for a wasted visit,1
Airport,"Terrible Airport ...80s era facility ... no comfortable seating .. few places to get work done during the constant delays ... hardly any power outlets .. bathrooms are filthy
endless terminals that require a sprint during connections ... thinks its a shopping  mall with endless overpriced stores between gates. Avoid at all costs!",1
Airport,Looks like an airport from the 70s. What a dump.,1
Airport,It was horrible I had to go through security twice went to the gate they said it was closed went back to exchange my ticket and then they reopened the gate what a nightmare,1
Airport,I am extremely disappointed in the security checkpoint from this Airport. March 8th was a disaster. Only 2 security guards were at the checkpoint. It made me and many others miss our flight to LAX. Atlanta needs more staff so that these types of situations never happen again. I wish I could give this 0 stars.,1
Aquarium,"Not what I remembered, it is not as interactive as it used to be , some of the attractions looked fake and it was just really overpriced for the experience!",1
Sports,Maybe spend some of that money making it more clear you are closed on Wednesday.  And why close during the middle of the week...3 very disappointed kids.,1
Airport,Horrible!!!! Such a bad airport. Not enough staff to help those of us who don‚Äôt travel here often! Restaurants are worse. Since when did cash become unacceptable?????,1
Theme Park,If I could give it a 0 I would this place sucks. The only way you‚Äôre gonna be able to ride something is if you spend $70 on a time saver pass after the $89 on a ticket. If you‚Äôre ever gonna go never go during a break go during a regular week day when everybody is working.,1
Aquarium,"Waste of money, small and old aquarium assi plaza got most fish than this. Too many hoggers occupying for way too long and blocking all view.",1
AZM,Wild animals belong in the wild not in tiny horrible cages shame on you,1

Museum,Extremely overcrowded.  We will hopefully come back another time.  Parking was crazy.,1
Airport,"Worst experiences ever. In Dec 2022, we waited over THREE hours after landing for our luggage to arrive at baggage claim. Here we are again.....flight landed at 0627. Sat on the tarmac waiting on a crew to assist in guiding the plane to park for over THIRTY minutes. Now we have been waiting for luggage for an hour......and still haven't seen anything. I wish there was another option in flying.",1
Theme Park,"Lines, lines, everywhere a line.  Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind.  If ya wanna do this, don't be fast, get in the line.

Lines to get in, lines for rides, lines for food, lines to buy t-shirts, lines to get out.  We waited over 2 hours to ride a Rollercoaster.",1
Airport,Exchange rate in the international terminal is absolutely criminal. How in the world are you justified in over 15% just to convert dollars. I unfortunately was stuck and had to exchange $1800. I was given under $1500 back in foreign currency. Never again. It's the airport's responsibility to regulate it's vendors and obviously they dgaf what they charge us.,1
Airport,I forgot how bad TSA check in is here. It‚Äôs been a few years but now I remember why I avoid it!,1
Aquarium,"Beware it was sold out on a Friday and they made us pay for parking just to find out we couldnt get in. Bad on me for showing up and expecting the place to be available, but charging us for parking is an absolute money grab.",1

Museum,This place was not interested at all. Very disappointed üò¥ü•±,1
Aquarium,If they are not doing limited time spots then I wouldn't recommend. Yesterday was pathetically crowded.,1
Museum,Completely garbage service. I paid for a tram tour and it's pretty confusing finding the correct line. I missed it by a couple minutes and guest services refused to compensate. Lady with red hair didn't seem interested in offering any alternatives.,1
Aquarium,"So small, so expensive, so dirty and so disorganized.  If you go, buy Tix in advance because they're timed.",1
Aquarium,"Extremely crowded, it was like 5 schools there at one time on afield trip making it extremely packed",1
Museum,We went yesterday and it was so crowded we could hardly move or enjoy anything. A waste of money. Not happy about that $200 down the drain just to fight crowds.,1
Museum,"Machines were broken, there were lines for everything, was told that one thing was down yet everything seemed to not be working. Just save your money and go somewhere else!!",1
Museum,I would give it a zero but that is not possible. They have the absolute WORST customer service ever! I will never got back or give them another penny.....EVER!!!,1
Aquarium,Number 1.The inconvenience of getting there. Parking was horrible. Having to pay 40$ to park is CV utterly ridiculous. Something needs to be done,1
Museum,"Ridiculous we drived 4 hours just to go see some lame pictures and it wasn‚Äôt even interesting, I don‚Äôt recommend this place",1
AZM,"Absolutely the worst! It was hot, there is no crowd control, you have to wait to ride anything, and I feel robbed. I wish I read reviews before paying the $35. Don‚Äôt waste your money!",1
AZM,"Hardly 30 folks and no management. Place is kept dirty, specially cafeteria area on 3rd floor. Stuff is good and Friendly, but wish they can maintain cleanliness and hygiene.",1
Aquarium,"Very crowded. Exhibits not impressive. Parking is difficult - lanes are not marked. The path to see all the exhibits is unclear. After parking in a downtown shopping center garage, there were no signs pointing to the aquarium. If coming from out of town, skip this ""attraction"".",1
AZM,"Rides were shut down. Many of the interactive games on the first floor were not working. This was our second time with the same issues. Came around this time last year, same thing. Many attractions not working correctly. Waste of money and won't return.",1
AZM,"Too expensive and not worth the money, a lot of things broken",1
AZM,Thursday at 1:30 in the afternoon and waited in line for an hour plus... Bought tickets prior to going.  Not worth it.,1
Aquarium,"There were soooo many people there, it was hard to see anything. Definitely NOT safe for young kids, as they can easily get lost or be trafficked. The 4.6 start google review is a joke.",1
AZM,"I purchased tickets this weekend for WonderWorks while at my son's State Tournament. The tickets were only valid for this weekend but you CLOSED for the entire weekend?
I will be in contact for my refund as you took my money but closed your doors for the only dates valid for entry.",1
Attraction,"If your child height is below 36'' or so, they won‚Äôt let it on 99% of the rides, not even riding with adults, including tea cups and many other basic rides. It‚Äôs ridiculous.",1
AZM,"Horrible staff, disorganized with check-in, especially with pre-ordered tickets.  Maybe this was a one of but our experience wasn't good at all.",1
Theme Park,"Wore these shirts to Dollywood for a family vacation, A worker stop me before i could walk in and asked a security guard can i wear these shirts inside of the park. Is their a policy about what you can wear inside of Dollywood? I will take this farther",1
Airport,"The baggage checker was being so rude and disrespectful to my grandparents, they were charging $60 extra for each bag and they wouldn't let grandma take her backpack so I have to carry it with me and most my family were really upset, I wouldn't rate 100 percent at all for having no respect to my family.",1

Theme Park,We were super disappointed on the park's ride line management.,1
Airport,I travel all over the country and deal with TSA all the time but at this particular airport they always have the most rude staff I‚Äôve ever encountered with TSA. I get they deal with all kinds of people but not everyone is the same so why be so rude? If you hate your job that bad and don‚Äôt like people please go find something else.,1
Museum,"Overpriced, interactive attractions are broken from a long time (years), simulators were closed today, next tram tour available in two hours, need urgent improvement. PS: this was a Monday (not peak season)",1
Theme Park,"Not plus size friendly
Legoland is not plus size friendly. A lot of the coaster require you to be smaller to fit safely. I was asked to exit several rides because I did not fit. Also, most rides require you to climb up or down stairs to enter or exit the ride.",1
Airport,"Try getting anything to eat at at B concourse after 9 pm ‚Ä¶ everything closes waaaay to early. Also, the men‚Äôs restrooms were trashed. I‚Äôve flown a lot, and this isn‚Äôt my first rodeo with this airport, but this trip was by far the worst.",1
Aquarium,"Would rate it zero stars if possible.  They are doing only online ticketing and failing gloriously.  Way over priced, employing people that have no job anymore, and it's on little tank they have.  It shouldn't be called an aquarium.  Save your money DO NOT GO HERE, EVER!!!!",1
Aquarium,Not the worst aquarium but way too expensive for how small it was ‚Ä¶ totally not worth the price ‚Ä¶ maybe cut the price in half,1
Aquarium,Not enough entertainment for adults. It needs to be like sea world. More live entertainment.,1
Aquarium,"The late albino alligator, known as Alabaster, was never real. Stop believing the lies people.",1

Aquarium,Very disappointed.  Expected much more.  Main aquarium enclosure plexi very dirty hard to see the fish.,1
Aquarium,"Feeble attempt to turn an aquarium into an amusement park. Exhibits are haphazardly placed and do not promote""flow"".  Some fish seemed to be neurotically swimming in tanks that offered no stimulation. The Tennessee aquarium is 100x better and well worth the trip.",1
Aquarium,Small aquarium and not many fish to look at. Pretty disappointing especially for the price.,1
Aquarium,Very disappointed in this Aquarium for the price.  They need to visit Georgia and Tennessee aquariums and take note. Very small and very few exhibits.,1
Aquarium,You have to buy tickets in advance and for a 25min window. If you miss the window...better luck next time! No refunds and no rebooking! TOTAL SCAM!!!,1
Aquarium,way overpriced for what it is....total disappointment,1
Aquarium,"Rather large rip-off, tbh. I would advise anyone to head to Columbia and Riverbanks Zoo. Much better experience (basically as good aquatic life), cheaper, and a full zoo.",1
Aquarium,only way to buy a ticket is online or cash.  online you have to give all your personal info.  Not very easy.  So disappointed.,1

The TSA agents here are what's ruining this airport.",1
Theme Park,"Absolutely disgusting sickening abomination of a ‚Äútourist attraction‚Äù. Not even slightly suprised the literal KKK used to meet here because it‚Äôs essentially a racism shrine. Anyone who enjoys going here is a freak of nature, and this dump should be closed indefinitely .",1

Airport,"they had no plane or pilot we was stuck made us miss a whole day at the hotel , && all they workers are rude , NEVER AGAIN",1
Airport,Airport had no healthy food options. Everything had seedoils. They play light jazz on a loop you might find in a supermarket in the 1990s. Water fountains looked dirty for bottle refill. Climate control kept temperatures rough five degrees above a comfortable level. Multiple delta credit card salesmen cat calling folks to sign up for sky miles rewards just trying to walk in the terminal.,1
Airport,Garbage airport.  ZERO concern fro travelers!!!!!,1
AZM,"$145 for 2 adults, 2 kids and took us 30mins. We have two in Tennessee that are way bigger and not near as expensive. Very big let down. The coolest thing was a 5 min 3D interactive video at the beginning. Save your money and experience 2 attractions for the price.",1
Airport,This airport security experience is horrible and paying for CLEAR does not help.,1

Aquarium,"I think it‚Äôs crap that people can‚Äôt bring in large strollers/wagons. How do you expect parents of multiple children to bring them all safely? 

So for my 3 kids I have to bring 3 single strollers which means I have to have 3 adults. 

Please explain‚Ä¶‚Ä¶",1

Aquarium,"No matter how much ""good"" you do, these animals do not belong in captivity. We could barely last a couple of months in lockdown yet we're fine with them being sentenced to it for life? Go see them in the wild and get involved in conservation so they're still there in the future.",1

AZM,"The 4D Cinema was very bad, dont do it!

Airport,"Disgusting airport. There‚Äôs liter everywhere. The bathrooms are akin to a prison, urine puddles have accumulated about a foot out from the urinals. Please get more custodial staff that regularly clean and pick up after the careless passengers. This is embarrassing when flying in from any other airport in the world.",1
Airport,"I guess Atl airport don't want people comfortable. Checking in, and departure waiting area has no A/C. I am seating at T11. And sweating like hack. I asked 2 worker about the how hot it is. Got responses that not my job. 0 star",1

Theme Park,Ridiculous prices no direct interaction came from Michigan just to come to Dollywood $316 dollars to get in and be taken advantage of,1
Aquarium,The obnoxious amount of people they stuffed inside of this place totally ruins it. We couldn't see anything due to thousands of people standing in the way. We will never return.,1
AZM,Way over priced. This ‚Äúfacility‚Äù is really just an overpriced arcade that you‚Äôre paying a cover fee to get into. If your kids aren‚Äôt at least ten years old don‚Äôt bother. Staff was mediocre at best and the place is an occupancy fire hazard. Don‚Äôt waste your time. 0/10,1
Airport,"Terrible signage, low light at night.",1
Zoo,"Snap/EBT tickets for $1 and because I have a job, go to work every day, and contribute to society, I get to pay for all the leaches? I'll take my kids to the wild animal sanctuary and pay more, to avoid socialism. Pathetic",1

Airport,"If precheck closes at 9, it shouldn't be closed at 855.",1
Airport,Worst experience of my life. Lost my grandsons luggage lost my son's suitcase and did not receive it until day before vacation was over. We had to stay in airport 3 hours trying to leave because of our luggage. It was an awful experience.  Hope I never have to fly out of Hartsfield Jackson again.,1
Airport,Don‚Äôt know how people are giving ratings higher than 1. Either they‚Äôre bots or just delusional since just by stepping in you can see how the place is about to fall apart. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the lines and absurdly placed barriers in random areas,1

Very over crowded and nothing was overly impressive other than the whales and balugas. Very expensive to walk around and look at a glorified fish store.... almost all the displays were smaller tanks.",1

Museum,WHO charges $1.5 for a cup?! Just an empty disposable cup so we can add water at the fountain. That‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous!,1
AZM,No parking. Rude staff. Zoo closed down before qctual closing time. Animals are all sleeping or the habitats are empty.  Just an overall bad experience as a whole.  The worst zoo that I've ever been to. Overpriced for what little there is here.,1
Theme Park,I tried to use 3 restrooms.  There were long lines at everyone.   Long slow lines for food and drinks.  Everything very high priced.   $25 to park.  Not the place for retired or large families-too expensive.,1

No thank you...not again for sure",1
Museum,"Such a rip off, I wanted to take my elderly mom to see the new Everest film, $10 for me $7 for her, that is awesome. Come to find out you have to pay the museum entrance fee too which we don't want to do. So now $65 to see a 45 minute film. Come on people.",1

AZM,"1 out of every 3 'attractions' did not work at all. Though the place was not crowded on Monday afternoon, it took 1.5 HOURS just to even get on the ropes course. For ~$30 per ticket, I expected way more. Save you time & money for other places.",1
Museum,"By far, the worst figures I‚Äôve ever seen. Save your money !!!",1
Airport,Worst airport ever! Food and service are horrible and the busiest airport food options shutdown at 10pm?!?! Hot garbage for it to be such a busy airport!,1
Museum,Wait is ridiculous even with all access tickets. Definitely not worth the wait or the money.,1
Museum,"The absolute worst of what's on offer in Hollywood. Overpriced for something that takes all of 10 minutes to walk through. With substandard wax models that look utterly disproportionate, the heads are too big for the bodies. And the cheek to charge $30!! I'd avoid this one.",1
