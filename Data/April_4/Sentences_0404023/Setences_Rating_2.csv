International Airport,European passengers at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport already fearing the worst with the new President Donald J. Trump flight ban. I just spoke to a passenger who landed 30mins ago from Amsterdam & he's already trying to get a flight out before it's not possible. CBS46 #coronavirus  #COVID19 #Atlanta,2
International Airport,Today is certainly a reflection of the gloom and doom in the world right now. atlairport #gloomy #fear #anxiety #coronavirus #panic #travel atlairport delta,2

International Airport,COVID-19's impact on the busiest airport in the WOLRD Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,2
International Airport,Much construction. Confusion when picking up customers.,2
International Airport,"At this time it was very frustrating because my husband was made to pay 209.00 because his flight was not registered. It is not fair, because he had already paid 153.00.",2
Airport,"A ghost town, the political and media fear tactics must stop",2
Airport,"I’m a Uber/Lyft driver and having us pickup so far from the terminals is really upsetting at lot of my passengers.  

We should be able to pick up at the terminals to make it easy for your customers.",2
Airport,"The shuttle buses to/from Terminal B are extremely limited. Several people had to wait for a single bus going back and forth. 

Lucky I made my flight. 

Add extra time.",2
Airport,WOW. Just got security checked at the Sacramento International Airport and the girl literally shoved her fingers up in my vahjayjay and she used such force checking my behind I almost feel and in pain. WTF security. I feel violated in SO many ways.,2
International Airport,"Sky train, walk, up down down up, security, train, walk and chic-fil-a only place open. Not even a starbucks.",2
Airport,"(Translated by Google) Bad

(Original)
Malo",2
International Airport,No place to charge my phone or electronics,2
International Airport,Had to walk 2 or 3 miles from landing area to baggage then to car rental!  Limited train action! Sad thing for nice large airport!,2
International Airport,I imagined hell and I got the Atlanta airport.,2
International Airport,"If you have connecting flights and you are hungry, you better have bought snacks in your first airport terminal because there was only 1 food vendor open! Ridiculous for an airport with as many concourses and terminals to not have enough care to have access especially since the flights have all but  eliminated inflight food service.",2
International Airport,"(Translated by Google) crowded

(Original)
Affollatissimo",2
International Airport,"They removed the smoking lounge, sad",2
International Airport,Crowded need a better way to get through TSA especially,2
International Airport,TSA agents are rude and need personal training on customer service with respect,2
International Airport,Today was terrible between terrible service and crazy people. This has by far been my worst experience at Hartsfield. Only decent person was the wheelchair attendant,2
Airport,"Most restaurants are closed. California pizza is open but it was $20 for a very small dried out pepperoni pizza
 Ugh!",2
Airport,40 minutes on the ground because a toilet will not flush,2
International Airport,TSA was not fully staff for the amount of people and there was a funny smell 🤨,2
International Airport,I was extremely disappointed in the facilities in Atlanta.  Only one fast food place open and one news stand type store with limited selection. The tsa  employees were curt during a security check. Other employees at the gate for southwest were wonderful.,2
International Airport,"Slow, one lane for TSA and very backed up.  Not laid out very well.  A lot of walking to get no where.  No shuttles available for older folks.  Very, very nice United agent (Diane) that was a huge help.  Needs to be more friendly, helpful and better layout.",2
International Airport,Large. Very confusing for someone who hasn't flown since 2005,2
International Airport,"My plane was delayed 3 times, and they change gates three times from one side of the airport to the other side of the airport. Very annoying and aggravating",2
International Airport,"Many of the eateries were closed. Then again the airport was like a ghost town. The line for Chic-Fil-A was nearly 80 yards long. We ate at PF Changs- $95, for two people.",2
International Airport,"When you spend a day traveling through several airports, you really notice the ones that give the extra effort to standout. You also notice the ones that don't (example: Atlanta International). Nothing over the top special. They do have some art sculptures around (but you need to search for them), children's art on the walls, and food options that you can find anywhere out in town.",2
International Airport,"Delta turn our flight around due to a maintenance issue.  While waiting for our new plane we were moved three times to different terminals so far.  Still am have not  boarded, so may not be the last.",2
International Airport,Baggage claim for my American Airline flight was too far away,2
International Airport,"Clean airport, hit or miss on staff. Some are amazing friendly others quite scowly. Found it odd I wasn't able to enter any lounges with a first class ticket.",2
International Airport,Traffic at the south terminal is still a mess,2
Airport,"There was no place to park in front of Arrival area. The parking officer kept telling us to move, but we had no place to go!",2
International Airport,"The lack of restuarant opens early are low, and the kiosk also does not accurately tell you when things are open either. I had tried a few outlets to charge my phone, but even after trying a few of them they would not work.",2
Airport,Very slow. 4 buses passed before one could pick up. This driver stopped taking passengers who were waiting while there was still quite a few empty seats and luggage space. He radioed in that the bus was full! Awful service,2
Airport,$12 a day and count on a shuttle only every 30 minutes. It's faster to just walk to the terminals don't wait for those people,2
International Airport,Really not user friendly anymore . Most workers are very rude.,2
International Airport,"Not much open due to covid which is understandable. Clean and easy to navigate. 5 stars for the airport itself, 1 star for how rude TSA is at this airport and the setup of TSA. Huge attitude for nothing. Very condescending and unprofessional. I get they have a serious job but it's uncalled for how they talk to people.",2
International Airport,"We put people first! #AETC #Repost discoverabletv with make_repost

International Airport,Thank you Frontier Airlines for the absolute worst night we have had.  And thank you  Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport for making it ten times worse,2
International Airport,"The customer experience, no matter the airline, can do better.",2
International Airport,Lack of soap in men's wash room,2
International Airport,The only issue I have was that when going through the security check they made us remove the snacks we brought for the kids out of the bags and tablets headphones. I mean whats the xray machine for if they're just going to have us remove everything in the bag.,2

International Airport,Everything closed down by 9pm except the blue moon brew restaurant in terminal B. They were open until 10 Thank god since my flight was delayed twice and my previous flight didn't get in until 915pm. There was SOOOO many people looking for anything to eat including flight staff.,2
International Airport,"Why is everything so ..... far ..... away ... from .... everything. You have to get on a train to get to the terminal. You have to get on a train to get to the bag claim. You have to get on a train to get to the car rental center. You don't walk anywhere in this airport. You take a train. Who designed this nightmare? Everything runs smoothly, but it's far away!",2
International Airport,People need to wear their masks properly,2
International Airport,Why is this airport ripping people off and it cost so much to here,2
International Airport,"Not everyone wearing masks,  and just casually taking them off.  Relatively cramped",2
Airport,Social distancing is just a sign they put up. There is otherwise no real attempts to encourage it. Big COVID fail. So much for flying being safe now.,2
International Airport,WuT PaNdIMiC! Lord other than a few hand sanitizer stations you wouldn't know a deadly super contagious disease was running rampant through the country. Avoid flying through here if you can.,2
Airport,I was scrambling from one terminal to the other to catch my 2nd flight. Had no idea how to get arou d.,2
International Airport,"Very crowded, very busy, no smoking inside anywhere",2
International Airport,I did not like the idea that we had to take a train to pick up the baggage and a train to go and check in whoever designed this Airport may have thought it would be a great nice-looking Airport sorry is lame,2
International Airport,"No food courts are open, its 6am and I need coffee!!",2
Airport,They still haven't figured out how to run a passenger friendly airport during covid. Most everyone else has.,2
International Airport,"most of the employees I interacted with were rude. The parking attendants are super friendly & helpful though. I think a lot of the employees don’t like their jobs & it shows. Either way that’s their problem, not the travelers. QUIT! ITS JUST THAT SIMPLE.",2
International Airport,"I was traveling Through, got to my gate and was Saddened to see Airport employees, standing together, with No mask or improperly Worn masks.  Then I saw a Group of ladies ALSO avoiding proper safty protocols.",2
International Airport,Busy but lines moved swiftly. More than a couple very rude airport employees specifically security check in,2
International Airport,Changing gates 30 minutes before the flight takes off when older persons are on the otherside of the terminal is NOT cool. I will avoid this airport if at all possible in the future.,2
Airport,Volaris Airline counter employees are horrible. They need more training and need to be more friendly. In a scale from 0 to 10 they get a negative 10. Horrible Service,2
International Airport,Definitely not my favorite airport. I can go done the list of reason why,2
International Airport,"Thousands of African cultured art pieces on display, but zero of anyothers culturs of art. The staff pretty much follows that same pattern too. You do not feel welcome here. Along with the shoe removal area thousands of feet touch that very dirty floor, before you get radiated. I wish there was another option for atlanta.",2
International Airport,Huge airport. Frustrating trying to find your way around.,2
International Airport,In Terminal F. 3 flights boarding at the same time. Everyone making announcements over each other. No one knows what is happening. No food options but the CNN store which is completely out of any refrigerated items to eat. Irritating for people who have to travel.,2
International Airport,This is a very large airport however the TSA employee were very rude!!,2
International Airport,"(Translated by Google) It's ordinary but it's not a good place to eat

(Original)
평범 한데 밥 먹을곳이 마땅치 않음",2
International Airport,"Staff are kind and helpful but this airport needs a major upgrade. Shuttle is slow and infrequent, there is only one concourse with food, few if any moving walkways and a cart for your bags is $6! Arrival is easy but if you are departing, arrive at least three hours before any flight, even domestic, because something is bound to hold you up. Plan on walking a lot to get to your gate.",2
International Airport,"Most eateries are closed today. Friday August 21 ,2020",2
International Airport,"Luggage carosel is very far and was in basement , AC not working and carosel broken . Very bad",2
International Airport,Not much open. People standing too close to each other.,2
International Airport,"The porters that stood outside of SWA with luggage carts didn't offer to assist me. I has with a pregnant woman and I use a cane. They quickly went to help a white gentleman that drove up after us. I never wanted to be one who throws the race card but, to see 3 black men not offer to help 2 black women was disheartening",2
Airport,"Lots of parking, fair place to wait if you're to early to pick up someone from the airport. Lighting isn't great, no bathrooms, nothing to do so I wouldn't suggest a long wait.",2
International Airport,It was very hard to find the North Gate. Ended up asking a security guard and she told me it was in the middle of the building behind a wall which took me a few to find. Then we we're moved through a big maze just to get to security. Not a fan of the setup here. Also i arrived at 5 am with nothing open for breakfast whatsoever.,2
International Airport,Interacted with 3 TSA agents and each one was so RUDE! The airport was much cleaner than normal for COVID which was a nice surprise.,2
International Airport,No social distancing protocol. Completely overcrowded. They are not practicing any safety precautions in regards to Covid except for masks.,2
International Airport,I got lost in airport ! Bad directions n÷ds a facelift,2
Airport,Its just an airport where everything is overpriced,2
International Airport,"The airport was nice, but the worker from Payless car rental / Avis car rental tried to steal $105.96 from me when I returned the vehicle. She said the computer does it automatically. I think she does it because she knows people are trying to make their flights.",2
International Airport,Wow...this place is very crowded,2
Airport,Southwest airlines employees were not very helpful on both legs of the flight to and from on the Sacramento side.,2
International Airport,Big and busy 😪  people have no  consideration for each other some women practically knocked me down got in front of me so she could check her suitcase first when it was my turn its a shame how some people act,2
International Airport,"No smoking area, looks like the whole country is trying to make ppl smoke.",2
International Airport,"Unfortunately restaurant on my gate closed, not sure if they closed early during pandemic and it's Saturday before 10 pm",2
International Airport,Why is everyone here so rude. You can say hello to someone and they have an attitude. I under stand they work for the airline and not the airport but it’s still a bad representation of the airport.,2
International Airport,The parking arrangements are way to confusing,2
International Airport,This airport is big and sprawling. It's very noisy many announcement tvs blaring and bad harsh lighting. The layout is very stark and the overall design feels like a mega bus station. No curved ceiling or rounded coves or arches just looks like blocks or shipping containers all joined together. The building is very uninspired,2
International Airport,At 8am there was only one place to get anything to eat. I under with covid precautions and fewer people flying the options might not be as great but still its not like it was 6am.  Even the McDonald's was closed.,2
International Airport,Catch Flights not feelings. I'll never fly frontier again unless I absolutely have to. Cheap hard seats and no tv🙄,2
International Airport,"Beware Concourse ""F"" !  After 6 p.m., there are nearly no places open that serve meals.",2
International Airport,"I still hate Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, but out of respect it will the first airport I fly to after COVID is over. #ATL",2
International Airport,A bit crowded for covid-19 to be around,2
International Airport,They should remake this place Franz Kafka airport. There are long halls leading nowhere.  I know this is the busiest airport in America but I felt like Gregor Samsa wandering the halls seeking knowledge and understanding but only getting the existential dread of missing my flight and being trapped here.,2
International Airport,Sucks that they got rid of the smoking bar.,2
International Airport,It's like a ghost town in some terminals. Lots of places closed. Lots of angry delta employees. I didn't hear the mayor's voice 100 million times so that's a plus.,2
International Airport,"I really didn't appreciate how one of the flight attendants treated me on my flight from Greenville to Atlanta airport. She jump on me an told me she done told me 3 times to put my mask on, it was very untrue. I thank the problem was that im white an she could treat me anyway she desired to. She belittled an humiliated for no reason. Delta 1247, Greenville to Atlanta.",2

International Airport,The baggage claim screens are not functional. You don't get any guidance on what aisle is your baggage coming to .,2
International Airport,Very large.  Directions not good.,2
Airport,Never have encountered more rude TSA than I have here.,2
Airport,The place is clean and nice looking. Low review is because  of the lack of directional signs inside the airport. If you're not familiar with this very large place you will go in circles. From where you're parked to the terminal you need to get to. Signage is horrible. Hope they fix this.,2
Airport,No restaurants were open in Terminal A.,2
International Airport,"Arrive at 730pm and no restaurants, not even fast food open. Very tough when traveling with kids",2

International Airport,"A bit convoluted in how to get to the rental car facility.  Don't follow the signs that say ""off site shuttles"".  Nip it in the bud and ask someone where to go!",2
International Airport,It’s winter. People are wearing/carrying coats and luggage. It’s entirely too hot in this airport.,2
International Airport,"Terminal E has no food. 50 hungry people were fighting for three leftover sandwiches. The vending machine is officially empty. 
Horrible hungry 4 hour with other similarly miserable, some drunk (of course, they leave the bar open and not one food option) travelers. Horrible. 0/10 would recommend",2
International Airport,"It's ATL! Not nearly as busy, and not many restaurants or businesses open.",2
International Airport,"We are in transit
From Jackson to Tampa .Arrived at 2 am due bad storm weather and our flight to Tampa is not till 0715 am .We are hungry ,nothing is open.  All Sky clubs are closed to 6 am or 7 am .",2
International Airport,People who work there can be a little more friendlier,2
International Airport,They need to enforce mask wearing at the gates.,2
Airport,"Lines And Closed Restaurants, But Lots Of People!",2
International Airport,"Only one food option after 7:00 pm, hundreds if not thousands of disappointed people. Maybe I'll open a pizza stand, charge $10/slice and stay open until midnight...probably retire in a year.",2
Airport,The only thing that gives ATL Airport any stars is The Varsity.,2
Airport,"Hectic, put personnel are friendly",2
Airport,Friday 7 pm - can't buy food in the terminal... Flying hungry.,2

Airport,Bathrooms were immaculate about 7 years ago,2

Airport,For someone who does not fly much that airport is hectic that getting around and finding our gate was challenging. I am planning on never going through that airport again,2

Airport,Lots of walking and not enough restaurants are open.,2
International Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport never seems to surprise me anymore 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️,2
Airport,"WORST AIRPORT EVER. beware - if you fly in or out past 7 pm, every restaurant is closed. I thought this was one of the busiest airports in the country and you have no food??? Crazy.",2
Airport,Traffic is a cluster f. . Bc people  are parking for longtime bc not one is making them move.,2
Airport,Airport is ok. Frontier Airline workers are very rude. Airport in general need to do a better job hiring friend employees.,2
Airport,Was not told that we had to be 3hrs early for flight cause of the holiday. So instead of getting a there at 7 something. We will be there sometime today.,2
Airport,I was not directed to the correct baggage claim area.,2
Airport,Airport needs more signs indicating the direction of car rental center. This was my first time to land at an airport and   couldn't find the rental car center. During my search for the rental center I ran into four other folks just as puzzled as myself as to the location of rental car center. A recommendation from me would add signage at all baggage claim areas with directional arrows.,2
Airport,Long lines. Be early. Have patience.,2
Airport,Like got just need some were for people to park when waiting on someone to come out the airport,2
Airport,"One of the most poorly organized, sign-posted, airport in America.  Service everywhere within is poor.  Similar to the Atlanta area at large.  Coupled with rude people/workers throughout.",2
Airport,"It was an experience I will never forget, and I don't mean that in a good way. Crowds and unbelievably long lines for rental cars and security checks. The only bright spot was our experience with our airline and attendants. Delta from Moline to Atlanta and back again. Top notch in every possible way!!",2
Airport,PARKING SCAM!!!! They will direct you to the hourly parking instead of telling you economy is full so you find out later they charge the triple there.Don't let them rip you off like they did to me.  Budgeted for $90 and had to pay $240!,2
Airport,We were the last flight to California so the employee want us all out,2
International Airport,Here at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport surrounded by folks eating Popeyes... GHETTO 😂,2
Airport,Super busy memorial day weekend,2
Airport,"I was surprised, for a major metropolitan airport! Sorely lacking. Security is despicable, longest lines I've ever experienced. Only one place open to get breakfast. Absolutely tiny for the size city it services.",2
Airport,Crowded! By 830 pm most food facilities were closed or closing.,2
Airport,"Need a shuttle. Had a 10 min walk with bags, not good",2
Airport,God I hate it here!....Home sweet home 😌,2
Airport,Lots of people are traveling.  Arrive early and pack some patience 👌,2
Airport,TSA.. had the worst attitudes ever.  No consideration regarding my personal items and at least two people had their I pads misplaced while going through checkpoint.,2
Airport,Get more economy lot shuttles for arrivals...,2
Airport,My experience was the BEST! I truly wish I knew everyone's names that helped me and were so wonderful to me...from getting my boarding pass at the kiosk to going thru security.. just incredible amazing people...a thousand thank yous. I'm so appreciative and grateful to all of you!!,2
International Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport done tricked me into signing up for CLEAR to get through the lines faster talking about it’s “free” Tell me why CLEAR trying to charge my card for $179,2

Airport,So many places are not open and you pay 20 bucks for a burger!,2

International Airport,Airport security did not allow me to check me bag and threw away $300 worth of fragrances,2
Airport,Crowded with no social distancing. Most of the elevators were out of services and no one to give direction or point you in the right direction.,2
Airport,To much walking every thing is  to far apart,2
Airport,"It's time to open the food places back up. Hand sanitation stations are well disbursed. TSA precheck was so unorganized.  They sent us through the scanning line with everyone else and we still ended up having to take off shoes, jackets etc.",2
Airport,"If you need wheelchair assistance, make sure you arrive extremely early (like 3 hours) because it is the slowest process of any airport I've been to yet. I would've literally missed my flight if it hadn't been delayed at the last minute. The person who did push me up to my gate was great though.",2
Airport,"Too warm - broke a sweat walking btwn gates.  Lines at most restaurants were 15 minutes, even the fast food ones.  Restaurant staff didn't seem too concerned with service.",2
Airport,This place used to be comfortable.... they removed all the couches and benches and replaced them with Burger King chairs. Barely any outlets to plug my phone in.,2
Airport,Hardly any restaurants are open.,2
Airport,It was at times confusing to navigate.,2
Airport,Yall need to connect the plane train to it.,2
International Airport,Very packed as usual but the lines move,2

The only redeeming facet was The Bar in Concourse A, so I could try to forget about the place.",2

International Airport,Very confusing airport and I've been to many 😕,2
International Airport,"Very dirty. Terminal S, gate B21 was very dirty.  Didn't look like it had been cleaned all day.  They can do better than that.",2
International Airport,Airport was fine nothing was hardly open to get food or drinks at 7pm when traveling all day be nice to be able to eat before arriving at final destination at 1030pm,2
Airport,Didn't  enjoy it food was not great,2
Airport,"It's an airport.  Nuff said. TSA is more miserable than ever. Flew today September 16, 2022 and the check in line was awful. I flew in January 2022 and practically sailed thru. Today it took an hour. The line moved, but everyone and their grandparents were on the line. A supreme test of patience.",2
International Airport,A lot of restaurants are close or have very long lines.,2
International Airport,"Well, there are LOTS of restaurants at Atlanta Hartsfield Airport.  However, it seams they cannot be bothered to be open @9:40 PM.  Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport - when there are close to 100 people in line for McDonald’s in Concourse E, you have a problem.",2
International Airport,No where to get any food after 7:00pm. People trading all day have to starve.,2

International Airport,"I don't understand how a large airport can have hundreds of folks landing and switching planes and not one place open to get a drink, bottle of aspirin or a snack. It was right at 9 pm... The entire side we landed at had about 20 places to eat, drink and newspaper places and not one open.",2
International Airport,Flew on a Sunday and only one place was open that had one worker and was so slow that we didn’t get anything to eat,2
International Airport,The traffic was very heavy for arrivals at 9:15 p.m. June 20th 2021,2
Airport,Whoever runs the shuttle buses at Sacramento airport needs to be fired. They have a standing in line for almost an hour waiting to get a shuttle to our car in the economy parking lot.,2
International Airport,No one to help with directions...vending machines didn't work,2
International Airport,Place was a mess... too many places closed for 1:00 in the afternoon. All the vending machines were empty. Of course you find this out till you've walked all the way down the terminal.,2
International Airport,Long lines. Everything was OK other than that.,2
International Airport,"Delta employee Errol Brown acted like he was put out to answer a question about my Delta flight from Atlanta to Charleston.   I'm sorry I put you out, Mr. BROWN.  It won't happen again as I have several other airline choices.",2
International Airport,"Confusing signage, cell phone lot only on south side of airport",2

I was really tired and in other airports, if the lounges are not open, I can discreetly sit down somewhere on the floor and rest. Not here.",2
International Airport,Lots of restaurants still not open.,2
International Airport,Another delay in flight... happens often in Atlanta.. ugh,2
International Airport,Why aren't there more choices in parking lots?,2
International Airport,"Traffic was a nightmare. Bad weather caused delays &  many drivers parked at the curb 3 & 4 lanes across, which caused traffic to stop. There was no police to direct traffic.",2
Airport,Needs clearer check-in instructions as to what lines to stand in. This morning at 5 am there were hundreds of disoriented passengers worried they'd miss their flights.,2
International Airport,"Almost all of the restaurants were closed at 7:30pm on a Wednesday. At the world’s busiest airport, hardly anything open. I went through 3 terminals and there were only 2 restaurants open. One restaurant closing provided a list of open restaurants and they weren’t even open. The lines for the two restaurants, McDonalds and an Asian restaurant, had lines going down the terminal.",2
International Airport,"Horrible layover on the way home to Tampa. Landed at 7pm, next flight at 9pm. Only 3 fast food restaurants open on the C concourse with 57 gates during dinner time. Waited 45 minutes for chinese food (not their fault, at least they were open). 1st time I've ever been at an airport and not been able to buy a drink. Was supposed to be a non stop flight so even more disappointing.",2
International Airport,"This airport is just too big. Nobody is happy to be here so every time I've had to pass through this airport has been miserable. I guess the airport is OK, it's showing its age but it's mostly about the jam packed everything and the lack of anyone caring about more than themselves that has me avoiding this airport at all costs.",2
International Airport,Staff was rude missed my connection due to delay I'm traffic control had to fly in to a different state to catch another flight to my destination I know thing happen they can't controll had they not been rude I would have given 4 stars,2
International Airport,Food lines were crazy long because everything was closed.,2
Airport,"Traveling this 4th of July weekend! Not only for Sacramento, CA (SMF) but for all city’s and states around the country! #4thofjulyweekend #safetravels #ArriveEarly #ExtraTime #airlines #AirTravel Chet's Adventures Beyond Sacramento International Airport",2
International Airport,"The cell phone parking lot needs much better signage. Also, Hartsfield Jackson is missing a chance to make some money. Put a concession stand in the cellphone lot! And hire some folks to clean it!

The passenger dropoff/pickup area is a zoo.",2
Theme Park,Not a rollercoaster person. Only went to take the kids.,2
Zoo,Why would you have a person at the beer garden who is younger than 18 and can't serve,2
International Airport,It is slow in every sense. They need to make operations more efficient.,2
Theme Park,They definitely could not accommodate the crowds today. 2 hour wait for food and they ran out of many items. No lockers were available either. Very expensive trip. Wish they would be more accommodating to their guests.,2
Zoo,"All the cages were kind of small, & the animals looked sad :(",2
Garden,"Limited menu. Rooms not cleaned due to covid for entire stay (staffing shortage). Pool too small for hotel of that size. Poor overall experience for a ""resort"".",2
International Airport,More than 1hr to get wheelchair assistant. Staff not very friendly at SWA.,2
Museum,Not impressed. When you purchase tickets to enter one would assume you would be able to see all the attractions... but no! You have to pay additional fees to see selected exhibits throughout the museum. I visited this museum many years ago as a child. This museum is not what it used to be.,2
Aquarium,It was ok mad about the pictures it say 20 for 1 or 35 for access to all but when you get online they want another 30$ not worth it I should have just got the 1 for 20,2
Theme Park,"Shuttle service to and from parking terrible, at least on the day I was there. Many things were not open inside park. Housekeeping generally not great. For the cost other amusement options much better.",2
Museum,"The wax museum in myrtle beach is better. This one seems a bit.more outdated and since there are no signs saying not to, teenagers were touching the statues and rustling their hair and clothing.",2
Theme Park,Not real happy most restaurants closed and more than a 2 hour wait for the ones that were open a little overpriced for what you actually get to do,2
Theme Park,Personally I think it is a bit overhyped. A lot of attractions were closed with no explanations.,2
International Airport,"With the rest of Georgia wide open and imposing zero covid restrictions, it would be great for this airport to follow suit. People are traveling and the airport is crowded but restaurants remain closed and there are absolutely zero amenities in the T gates. It's terrible. I mean, if your idea of good food comes from a vending machine, you're all set. Otherwise, the struggle is real!",2
International Airport,"We arrived at 6:30 pm for a 9:45pm flight. Almost all the food places had already closed, on concourse E just about the only place open was McDonald's and the was a VERY long line. The vendors should be required to stay open longer.",2
International Airport,"There covid safety protocols are a joke.... Stop telling me to social distance when your gate area don't allow that, your food line stretches 3+ gates and I didn't see 1 hand sanitizing station except outside the restroom.",2
Theme Park,Everything is over priced including the tickets and now if you ride the river rampage they won't let you put your bag to the side you have to rent a locker. I used to love Dollywood. We won't be back. Poor families couldn't afford it and that's not fair . You have to be well off to take your family,2
International Airport,"Traffic appears to be up to nearly 90% of normal, yet many shops and food vendors remain ""Covid closed"", this makes the open shops and food places overcrowded and difficult to manage in reasonable time between flights. Avoid if at all possible. However, note that this status appears to be common among airports.  Still maintaining hygiene theater, too, but that is to be expected",2
Theme Park,"It wasn't a technical or long hike. Did it in 30 minutes. It's more so of a family activity. I've conquered much higher altitudes, so it wasn't too easy for my taste.",2
International Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson needs much better traffic management. Seriously.,2
Zoo,Very few animals...walked 4 hours to see a tiger & 1 elephant...aquariums were ok,2
Garden,"Ugh. Lots of flowers, but the mosquitoes here were AWFUL. We couldn’t stay long because they were swarming so badly. There were no indoor places open for us to get relief. Two stars only because they did at least have healthy plants.",2
Zoo,Somewhat disappointed with the amount of empty exhibits. It is a zero nice zoo otherwise.,2
AZM,"Mile high drop, raging rapids, and the ferris wheel are closed. They were last year too. So pretty much just coasters and the water park. They should notify customers before they buy tickets and discount the tickets as well. Not worth the money. Holiday world has free drinks too.",2
Aquarium,They barely checks the ticket and seems like anyone can iust sneak in along with others. Massssss crowd inside and hard to watch. Food costs $$$$$$ (as expected just like other tourist destination). Hope they imrpove soon.,2
International Airport,It’s 7 pm at terminal E out of this huge airport and McDonald’s is the only thing open besides a bar (I have a kid) and the line is wrapped around past the bar. No way I can get food in time. All the stores are closed besides a stereo store (cause that’s useful?!). I had a connecting flight here and needed food for me and my son but I guess we will go on a 4 hour flight hungry.,2
Zoo,"Okay zoo, is in the middle of improvements so some of the exhibits are empty.
Funny moment: hippo sign inside said look for hippo outside, zoo keeper outside said hippo inside...we told him what sign said...and a awkward silence occurred.",2
International Airport,One McDonald's open at terminal e and not even one store open to get a snack or drink.,2
Museum,It was alright. Wish there was more hands on stuff like the fun oklahoma one. This one is not as fun. After 2 hours i left,2
Zoo,Hardly any animals out. Hopefully the renovations improve this zoo.,2
International Airport,Got to the airport at 4am. Hit the baggage kiosk and after that it goes downhill. The lines for Spirit were beyond busy. We were directed by 3 different people to 3 different lines. That took about an hour and we still had to catch the train to the concourse and our gate was all the way at the end of it. My issue is how unorganized things were upon arrival.,2
International Airport,Weather delays so spent 4+ hours at airport.  People had to sit on floor in waiting area and up and down concourse because there were only about 60 chairs for 175+ passengers.   Area is not very handicapped friendlu.,2
International Airport,TSA needs to work on their customer service!A woman was frustrated with how slow the pace of the line was moving and rudely expressed so by rushing myself and 7 others. Completely unprofessional Besides the airport was clean and functional,2
International Airport,It was ok. We were delayed for 5 hours. Every place we went to had long lines. Very crowded.,2
International Airport,This is a really big and nice airport. But baggage claim is a far walk!!! Catch a tram to baggage claim or you're on for a 15 minute walk after landing!!! And if your flight gets in too late....like after midnight...you will have to walk 'cause the trams won't be running!,2
Aquarium,Price for admission is high. Also food is really expensive. Took family 3 hrs to see everything. Employees were not engaged with guest. Not very informative about the animal residents. Will not return,2
Theme Park,They now do not allow you to use your gold pass food discounts for friends and family.,2
International Airport,"Mad house, long lines, few places to eat at 8:00 PM",2
Theme Park,Not really ready for the summer crowds yet.  Lots of things not open yet.  Very dissappointing after shelling out big bucks for a season pass.  Hopefully when we come back again things will be better.,2
AZM,"Overpriced and overrated. If you want an authentic aquarium, make the extra drive. This select one was just too much money for too little entertainment. The only thing I liked was the sting ray touching and climbing area.",2
International Airport,Very very busy large airport! Gates will change in a blink of an eye and you will find yourself turning into a track star running throughout the airport.,2
Aquarium,"Aquarium is always nice. I called in to get a membership. Helen was rude and unhelpful, then to top it off, she hung up on me in the middle of a sentence.",2
Museum,Highly crowded and not as expected. Over priced and lines for everything. However the mock rockets they had were very cool but would've been a better experience if it wasn't as crowded.,2
AZM,Very cool place but not worth the 10-15 minutes it took to be pushed through. Several employees were VERY RUDE to everyone.,2
Theme Park,The best ride in the park was closed. Twisted Typhon,2
International Airport,6:30 on on a Sunday and everything is closed??? So much for comfort and convience for your visitors,2
International Airport,Very very busy airport... In need of cleaning.. gate area very trashy,2
International Airport,"Sunday 7:30 PM there were no restaurants open whatsoever in the whole F concourse
This is the area for international travelers",2
Theme Park,"good park but I we won't go back
The park is nice but it really bother me  to pay $700 for four tickets for a place that pay their employees $ 8.00 an hour...",2
Museum,Very commercialized.  If you are looking for amusement park with lots of people go for it.  Not why we go to the beach.,2
International Airport,Had a great time in florida glad Bridgette Smith came up with the idea to go plane anxiety is creepy all them damn people and that fucking Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport  is crazy,2
AZM,Hot an opens at 7 but bring your own drinks til 8 nothing food or drink don't open til then an bring $$ water $7.00 a bottle,2
International Airport,"Why is this place always so much chaos for no reason. Tried checking in to the kiosk and was harassed by the people there to help when no one was in line. Went to security and employees yelling where to go and unfriendly. There were clearly marked signs to follow, which we were, but everyone was so aggressive. Definitely no Southern charm here.",2
Museum,Not worth the price for what it was .. $ 29.99  per person just too mich money for what you got which was taking pics with max hollywood celebrities..,2
International Airport,Atlanta airport needs to get their act together!!!! 🤬 Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,2
International Airport,"As a business traveler, the lack of sufficient restaurants open during early morning hours is sad. Especially during summer when more people are traveling. Waiting in line for over 40 min to order breakfast is ridiculous.",2
Zoo,"Lots of animals off exhibit. Paid $10 for parking pass in advance, but parking was free. No refund. Felt cheated, not really the money just the point of it",2
Theme Park,"Meh. Won't go again. Poor park layout, food solutions very lacking, no air conditioned.spaces. save your money.",2
Theme Park,I have sat on the phone on hold for over 2 1/2 hours never talked to anyone. I have called left phone number and no return call over a week ago . We love this park very sad that this is happening.,2
Theme Park,"I think Dollywood should change the coal burning train to an electric one.
The smoke from the black flume got into our eyes, made us cough & got all over us.  The black smoke could be seen all over the park.",2
Aquarium,Not much to see for the price you pay.they should let you see something free..,2
AZM,"Nice , but it's too small... not worth for your money... paying almost $40..",2
International Airport,"This is a huge international airport, and they close their restaurants and cafes at 7 pm. Either they don't know that people fly 24/7 and get hungry when traveling or don't care. Probably the latter",2
Museum,Took Doug to Space Center Houston to see where my daddy used to work.,2
International Airport,When will the city of Atlanta and Delta stop preventing a second commercial airport for Atlanta.  Busiest (which it no longer is) doesn't mean best.  Name a great international city with only one airport...,2
Theme Park,Went for the laser show and it was rather boring. Also no social distancing was being enforced.,2
International Airport,Does anyone know if I have to take a covid-19 test if I’m going state to state in the U.S? I’m flying on Delta airlines.,2
Airport,No Food Court is available until you go through TSA. Then choices are Over priced and Very Limited Selections,2
Theme Park,Def wasn't impressed especially for the price to get in ..1 adult and 2 11 year olds cost me about 220$ ..Line for the rides were super long..Wouldn't go again,2
Aquarium,"Tried buying tickets online. Something happened at checkout in which I never received my tickets but I was still charged the full amount for 2 adult tickets. Tried calling them the next day right at 9am and was on hold for half an hour, still never received tickets or a refund.",2
International Airport,Cashier at exit ran out of change,2
Aquarium,Gave it 3. I loved it but it was way to crowded to enjoy. People need to understand to be courteous of others & not stand at a exhibit having a conversation. Take a couple of pictures and move out the way. We all paid around the same amount to be there.,2
International Airport,Almost every restaurant closes at 8pm. WTH??? The couple of places that stay open have no staff and extremely long lines! It's ridiculous!,2
International Airport,"So big and busy. Stressful traveling with kids in such a massive airport, having to walk or run for so long to where you need to board.",2
International Airport,TSA is short handed. It's scary..,2
Theme Park,"My beef is: we bought souvenior cups, 70.00 worth.  There was no ice to be had on this hot day and every drink station was either closed or out of ice and drink. So we spent 70.00 for 1 drink on a hot day with no ice. I called for a manager but he or she never showed up.",2
AZM,"Not worth the price of admission. Very disappointed.  The submarine 5D room was unique, jelly fish mirror maze was ok.   Able to go start to finish in 45 minutes easy.
Travel a little farther and go to Wonders of Wildlife in Springfield, MO.  More bang for your buck!",2
International Airport,This airport has lots of good food choices but there was trash everywhere and sticky food on the electrical outlets. The usb ports also didn’t work on most chairs.,2
Museum,It was so jam packed in there you couldnt enjoy any of the activities,2
International Airport,"Had to find our own wheelchair and navigate the airport by ourselves after giving up on the one that was ""on the way""",2
Aquarium,Carpet should be removed it is very old and why have carpet @ an aquarium Overall experience id say a 2 out of 5,2
Zoo,Most of the animals were not out. Lot of construction. There is one spot in the zoo where it’s just a lot of pollen that you walk through - this made me sick for the entire week I was in Denver. Wish there was a warning sign or something before walking through this area. :(,2
Theme Park,"you need a better app, help disabled people know what they can go on or can't.  it was so hard to figure anything out ! also",2
Airport,"No curbside check in after 4pm. If you need assistance getting inside to the ticket counter bring a friend.
After exiting the screening machine the TSA employee  stood there not offering an arm or hand to a gentleman that obviously  needed help.
She just stood there.",2
International Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport I just fucked y’all bathroom up 😭😓😷😮‍💨,2
Airport,Pick up are is too small for lots of cars. They made us drive in circles for a long time,2
Aquarium,"Sold out!?!? Really? How do you sell out? It's literally just walking around looking at fish. Would of been nice if you would of put it on the website soon. That way people don't drive 95 miles to be told too bad, we sold out.",2
Museum,The website says skip the line and buy tickets. This is a BIG FAT LIE. They trick you and say that it is only the ticket booth line which is not existent. You have to stand in line for a long time.,2
Museum,"Too crowded, system for getting a tram ride is terrible
Spent more time in line for things, than actually seeing things",2
Museum,"Pricy tickets - but doesn’t include any of the special exhibits, which is frustrating. There seem to be no employees to answer questions. The people selling tickets were not friendly. However, the building is beautiful.",2
Museum,Only took us 20 minutes to go through. For the price it was not worth it.,2
Zoo,As usual most if the animals were not visible to see. But overall it's okay.,2
Theme Park,"They r charging way to much now. It $20 per person just to watch the lazer show, which used to be free.",2
Airport,Crowded for Saturday afternoon.,2
Theme Park,"Out of everything. Staff really not friendly , it has seen better days.",2
Aquarium,Unhappy with the seeing the fish and it was way too many people there.,2
International Airport,Not enough agents for the amount of people.,2
Theme Park,Did not enjoy my day. Over half of the water park was not working and the food vendors were way under staffed for the amount of people inside the park.,2
International Airport,"Should it really take an hour and a half to get through security?  And then the trains aren't running and you have to run to the terminal just to find out that they won't let you on the plane by no fault of your own?  Seriously, for a major city, this airport can do way better",2
Theme Park,Busy place today and restaurant we wanted to eat at was closed.,2
International Airport,Entirely too crowded but there's nothing you can do about that. Was in the line at security for well over an hour and there were people crying because they had missed their flights. I have to say everyone I talk to as far as staff were very friendly except one,2
Zoo,"Fist time coming to this Zoo. Not sure if it’s due to lack of funding after Covid, but there were barely any animals. No tigers, lions, gorillas, or hyenas. The water was very dirty and the grass seemed like it wasn’t maintained well.",2
Theme Park,"Rude employees. Outrageous prices for just 4 big roller coasters. Fun and cute place but the employees are disrespectful, inpatient, and rude. Especially the workers at the ticket booth, ticket scanners, and security lines.",2
Theme Park,Not very big or very many rides. I expected much better things.,2
Aquarium,Really not worth the $36.00. To really get the full effect you will need to pay extra for the shows and behind the screen action.,2
International Airport,TSA at its finest. Line out the door. One boarding pass checker person. The Walmart of airports. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport you suck.,2
Theme Park,Very disappointed that the stay at the Evergreen hotel doesn't offer a shuttle to the laser show anymore. No room service.,2
Zoo,"Very crowded to the point that it's difficult to even move, and doesn't have much to offer that most other zoos already have. Would recommend Indianapolis zoo.",2
Aquarium,tickets needed to be ordered ahead of time for visitation but parking was a mess and aquarium was much too crowed. employees were helpful.,2
Zoo,You couldn't see in some of the cages because they had plants in front of them that were to tall to see over. A lot of the cages were empty.,2
Zoo,"very small zoo. I looked through all the exhibits and only saw the lemurs, meerkat, polar bear, tiger, and sea lions. all other animals were nowhere to be found or sleeping...",2
Airport,Small and lines were long...very long,2
Museum,"It was a nice place, very busy and a very long wait to get in. No organization once inside. One visit is enough.",2
Zoo,"This zoo is not laid out well at all. You can go one way or the other, but cannot get through if you want to skip. Then you need to go to the complete beginning to get to the correct path. Be prepared for a LOT of walking! Animals were great. Flowers were beautiful.",2
International Airport,Most of delays more then 30 times,2
Museum,Major let down.  Several attractions didn't work properly.  Way too expensive for the overall experience even if everything was functioning normally.,2
Theme Park,For $70 it's not worth it. Half of the rides were shut down. Half of the food stands were closed.,2
Zoo,"Not really worth the price of admission. Most exhibits were either empty, under construction or animals were ""out of habitat"". Columbus zoo was much better.",2
Theme Park,"This place has great rides and a lovely atmosphere, but was overcrowded and under staffed. Letting in too many people without enough staff really hurt the experience.",2
Theme Park,"Nothing special, to many people and not enough employees. Wait time for any food 2 hrs. Not at all what we expected!!!",2
International Airport,There is a DRASTIC difference in quality of experience and customer service in Transportation Security Administration - TSA at Denver International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Denver is superior in every category.,2
Museum,Too pricey. Not very much to see compared to other museums.,2
Aquarium,Overly crowded and the design doesn't aide in  the flow of people.,2
Theme Park,Unacceptable Hot as hell in summer Barely any cooling like fans Will never take family ever again,2
Zoo,Bad day most  Enclosures were empty. Paying so much extra for the new exhibits didn't Excite me. If I wouldn't have had extra money on me my grandchildren would have been major disappointed.,2
Zoo,The train broke down and we was waiting for 40 minutes to just have to walk away,2
International Airport,Not many food choices. Only 2 Starbucks in the same concourse in the entire airport and there are huge lines.,2
Zoo,Unfortunately didn’t enjoy my time here. Not sure when their closing times are since there at three different ones.,2
International Airport,Why did it just take an hour and 10 min for me to get through this customs line Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport 😤,2
Theme Park,Very disappointed.  Not very clean. Things closed up. No shows.,2
Theme Park,"We took our grandkids for the first time yesterday. Don't think we will be back. Most of the food places were closed and it is very expensive. We paid with cash and they didn't have change, so everything had to be rounded up.😔",2
Airport,Way too small for all the travelers passing through. Updates to gates are nice but still lack seating,2
Theme Park,My mom and I only got yo ride 2 rides while we were there the whole day because every time we about to get on a ride it shut down for maintenance. Wish we didn’t spend all our money on this :(,2
Theme Park,"Cool rides, best thing about cool rides is that they're just for show you'll never be able to get on half of these rides due to maintenance issues been here for 9 hours got on 1 ride and waiting in the second line still I would advise not coming unless you're into boredom.",2
Zoo,"Didn’t see much in the way of animals,  lots of hills.",2
Theme Park,The park attractions were mostly closed. Thought I was in a place that wasnt open for business. Not much to do except climb that mountain.,2
International Airport,Parking is cheap but i waited 2 hrs for my family before they came through the gates,2
Theme Park,They charged full price yet half the rides were not working. The majority  of snack bars and places to eat were also closed.,2
International Airport,Can't even buy decent coffee in teinal T.,2
International Airport,"Y’all. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is no joke. First of all it takes me 30 minutes to get from my parked car to the gates for me to clock in for work. Also, everything is so spread out and far from each other. I had a work out today!!! I’m getting ALL of the steps in.",2
International Airport,No food available at 7pm was not the best when you are traveling,2
AZM,Was very fun up until one of the waves they had going pulled me under water and no lifeguards helped me,2
Airport,Why are the restaurants & stores closed at this busy airport?,2
Resort,"Bed bugs
Bed bug bites and they deni it. I called then emailed pics took almost 2 weeks for a response. They said pest vontroll and bed bug dogs did not confirm bugs. I have the pic to prove it. Pool was dirty by late afternoon, which can be understood. Otherwise everyone was very friendly",2
Theme Park,You cannot buy Cinnamon Bread while waiting for the National Anthem. Another long time tradition gone. I need to speak to the manager.,2
Theme Park,"They closed the rides due to weather, the weather quit as soon as they did.....",2
International Airport,"Beware that if you are hungry after 7 or 8 pm, there are very few places that you can eat. Even then, the lines are ridiculously long.",2
International Airport,Most confusing airport I have ever been for a first time flyer alone,2
International Airport,Delta agent was not very helpful.,2
Aquarium,Even with scheduled ticket times it was still overcrowded and no way to distance from people and still see what you paid for.,2
Zoo,No parking available.  Had to park 1/2 mile away. Very crowded on a Friday afternoon.,2
Museum,They don't tell u 300 lbs u can't do the stuff inside. 60$ down the drain,2
International Airport,Hectic process getting through checkpoint.,2
International Airport,Crowded and not enforcing mask wearing even for employees.,2
Theme Park,We are local and have season tickets.  Planned date night to eat and watch shows this evening.  Sad restaurants we wanted to eat at were closed.  No shows on Saturday after 5:30.  We won’t be renewing season passes next year.  We understood during COVID but this is ridiculous.,2
International Airport,"Of tons of people are traveling at dinnertime and after, why are all the places to get food (including snacks) closed?! We got on a plane at lunchtime (so we didn't have lunch) and arrived to a 3 hour layover where EVERYTHING was closed at 8:30pm.",2
International Airport,There are never any clean chairs or tables in the food court. Even if you wait from close to open. They sit at the dirty tables and congregate instead of actuality cleaning. Tables are all filthy. Definitely not any extra surface cleaning for new covid surface strains.,2
AZM,"To crowded, pay for free drinks and most the bibs are out, can't get ice out of any machines. As well hurricane bay could half a few less bandaids floating around and at the bottom.",2
International Airport,Told employee at check in of handicap.   Which was on ticket too.   Was to stay in certain area.  Was never acknowledged when everyone was boarding.  My child helped more than Delta employee.  Thankfully we did not miss the flight.,2
AZM,It was not what we expected. Not a lot of things for children to ride. Especially water rides. The staff are not too friendly either.,2
International Airport,Needs more employees to help with the general public.,2
Zoo,A lot of the animal enclosures were empty or only a single animal occupant. Only the main cafe was open.  Ice cream stands and the other food place was closed.  Gift shop was near empty.,2
Theme Park,Not a park for older kids. My 8 yr old was not impressed. Went to the waterpark on the second day.  The slides were closed so we only stayed for a few hours.,2
Water park,Insanely busy. They should have a reserve status for handicapped people bc no one will give him any seats even if you have your crutches. Had to lay on the cement. And they ran out of food in several places.,2
Aquarium,It's not what I expected. I was looking for more with all the hipe in the advertising. And the cafe charged me more than they should've for my food,2
Airport,Restaurants had limited menus and outrageous prices. Was also not impressed by shop variety. No family restrooms to be found.,2
Aquarium,Beluga whales not shown again...disappointing...get control of crowds for dolphin show...,2
Aquarium,Met this bad ass octopus at the shedd_aquarium today,2
Theme Park,"We spent the day at Dollywood, found out there was firework show later tonight, we meet up with more friends. Enter the park when we were meet by two guys directing cars that were extremely rude!  Instead of being polite telling us where we could park they were so rude.",2
Zoo,"There were barely any animals out. And some of them looked starved, like a fox we saw. Aquarium was decent.",2
Zoo,Spending $40+ Dollars on tickets for a family with small kid driving more than 1 hr is not worth it.,2
Theme Park,"Super long lines for a weekday, some rides were shut down at some points of the day.",2
Theme Park,The vendors wasn't at full capacity.so it made the food lines long.and some of the theaters were closed,2
Theme Park,Dollywood I’ve been on hold over 1.5 hrs now trying to speak to a representative. Is anyone working or am I wasting my time? I called 3 times last week and used the ‘press 1 for a callback’ but no one ever called me back.,2
Theme Park,"Extreme Wait times
We waited in a 45 minute line at a food truck that only made chicken tenders and fries!  After the same experience at Dollywood the day before, we are not impressed with the parks.",2
AZM,"Not all of the rides and water features were open. One of the bars couldn’t serve beer because no one was old enough! 🤷🏻Assuming they’re having staff issues like everyone else. But there’s so much to do here, we made it work. Good day all in all.",2
Zoo,"Zoo is expensive, caters only to the members club, general public gets leftover's. Not impressed. Out of town family wanted to visit, equally not impressed",2
Museum,We got in line to go in and saw the pricing and turned around. Its literally outrageous to walk thru a wax museum!! Branson is cheaper and has the same stuff. Im not sure how a family would afford this place. Very greedy with pricing! No thank you,2
Theme Park,"Well, I guess we shouldn't have expected much for 11:00-11:30 on a Monday in late July. It was hot and steamy. None of the stores or restaurants appeared open and it was just plain hot and disappointing...",2
International Airport,Need to have better signs to direct you to the rental car center. I spend 30 mins to find the rental car center once I arrived at the airport.,2
International Airport,Storms this evening with many flights delayed until late. The terminal trains are packed - 5 minutes between trains as if everything is normal.  Typical Hartsfield - no planning when things are not normal.,2
International Airport,"Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is a HOT Mess! I have NEVER seen the airport like this. Glad I got on tennis shoes.... I had to walk to Baggage Claim from B after sitting on the plane for 45 minutes.

THEN, the board is not updated to tell you the baggage claim to find your luggage. You have to walk to each claim #SMH",2
International Airport,"Most main restaurants and shops closed before 6pm, long lines at the fast food restaurants. Thanks to a weather delay, found out even the general goods shops with drinks and snacks were closed earlier than what I have ever seen at any other airport. There were still people waiting at most gates to leave. To the point that there was a long line for the mostly empty vending machines.",2
International Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport please don’t piss me off at 1:50 in the am. I’m tired and I gotta work in 4hours I just want my bags. #YourBaggaeClaimSystemSucks,2
Theme Park,"Staff was unfriendly. Bought season passes for my entire family, and am slightly regretting it now.",2
International Airport,The building needs some more circulation or the AC turned down. It is uncomfortably hot and humid unless it is below 70 degrees outside. There also is very limited open shops/restaurants open past 10pm.,2
Airport,The food places were closed both in the night and morning when we arrived. The vending machines didn't work right either. This airport needs better signs and distance markers.,2
Theme Park,There were just too many people here the day I went. Only went on one ride.,2
International Airport,Bathrooms smell and the restaurants are your basic 2 star joints.,2
Zoo,Not good directions for seeing the animals. It was not what I expected.,2
Airport,"Sacramento Airport website indicates parking payment kiosks are on level 1, lobbies C and D. No such places. No signs indicating where anything is located. The help I received agreed the airport was terrible at showing where anything is located. Come on guys, you can do better than that. At least remove the bad info from your website. It's the California State Capital Airport for Christ's sake.",2
International Airport,"For an International airport, don’t close your food shops down at 9 pm. Some closed way earlier 7pm. By 9pm about the only thing you can get is the water fountain! Pathetic!!!",2
International Airport,"Very busy. Long lines always! Be proactive. Don't wear jewelry,  wear easy removable shoes like flip flops,  have your ID & ticket ready, and remove EVERYTHING from your pockets. Give yourself a safe 3hrs before your flight.",2
Zoo,"not very explanatory...lots of empty space,, food area slim and expensive",2
International Airport,Need more personal at security check point,2
Theme Park,It cost a lot for admission and the hotels around it. It was understaffed and the rides were decent. It started to rain and everything shut down. It took half an hour to get a cold drink and food but it was unsanitary.,2
Museum,"We've been taking our daughters here for the past 8 years and nothing has changed, nothing updated and now they require credit cards or debit cards only no cash which was a big inconvenience for us because we don't like using cards when on vacation simply because of the risk of fraud",2
International Airport,Def needs a Bathroom Remodel. Not cool closing the little concession stands and restaurants early. Gate A has the restaurants that close later then the rest,2
International Airport,Was so looking forward to getting Bojangles before I got on the plane. The website said they opened up at 5  and there was someone there but I couldn't get her attention to ask her what time they opened up.. bummer!!,2
Water park,"Mediocre water park. There are spots that just reek of urine smell. The filtration system needs some TLC. Right before lunch hour, they're already out of half the menu. Get it together, White Water.",2
Theme Park,We had a good time but the gentleman working there scolded us for entering through the wrong door when we first got there. There were no signs dictating which way to enter and we were just in the line waiting our turn to enter. Not good customer service.,2
AZM,"It was an ok aquarium, but definitely not worth the money.",2
Theme Park,Starting to look super run down... The lazy river looked like a trash dump... The wave pool had no waves when it kicked on... They should feel really embarrassed to even call it a wave pool... They need to change it to a ripple pool SMH ... Fix it! And I might recommend,2
Aquarium,"It took 35 mins to walk through it SMH that's a dollar a min. We walk at a average pace too . At moments it seemed  like i was at pet smarts fish department , excluding their main center tank. Good for 14 and under though",2
Museum,My teenagers spent about 1.5 hours in all three attractions. They thought it was cool but I'm not sure it was worth the price for admission. $40 for all three attractions.,2
International Airport,"This used to be a great airport. Now most dining is closed as are many stores, making it difficult to find food at many terminals most of the time. I'd avoid it if I could.",2
AZM,Definitely not worth the price of admission. Have been to much better aquariums for less cost.,2
International Airport,"Easy to see this is the busiest airport in the US... Crowds everywhere making it hard to move around and even harder to social distance. Plus, a lot of folks are not wearing masks. Most shops in concourse d are closed and the spaces are dirty (as are the restrooms)...",2
Theme Park,Half of eating place where close. The rest close at 8 and the free refillable cups u pay a arm and legs for u couldn't refill. But place that just sold bottles for $3.75. Where open until 9:30.,2
Zoo,"They close too early and we couldn't see half of the exhibits. Also, the prices were steep. Getting around was challenging.",2
Theme Park,"Not enough eateries,  train ride was not enjoyable because people were packed in so tight. Prices for game vouchers were way too high. Merchandise was reasonably priced. I would not go back.",2
Zoo,Not enough animals out.... maybe because of heat... also not layed out like other zoo's.,2
Zoo,It's maintained well. But the food was horrible. Canned water was super expensive.  It's better to take outside food. I will never visit this place again..,2
Garden,It wasn't that great  if you want to know about farming yes then go,2
Zoo,Alot of the exhibits were closed and over grown with weeds.,2
Airport,Lousy airport. Limited food options. No lottery locations.,2
AZM,"Fun little place, very disappointed that half the rides were not running, not sure if it is due to lack of staff or other reasons. Would recommend Holiday World or Kings Island, much better experience.",2
International Airport,#Toosii says he was racial profiled coming through the #Atlanta Airport.,2
International Airport,"Planes delayed by 45 minutes because not enough employees to clean the planes in a timely manner.  All the restaurants were closed by 8:30 pm which is bad when planes no longer serve meals.  I realize this is mostly the result of labor shortages after the pandemic, but this made for a miserable experience. I raised the score from 1 to 3 because I remember it not being this way in the past.",2
International Airport,"This airport is dirty and understaffed. So, so dirty. Crumbs, trash, food debris at every gate and food court table. Half of the concessions are closed, half of the stores are closed. The concessions that are open have shortened hours of operation. Weirdly, the restrooms were clean. I guess the janitorial staff priorized the restrooms.",2
International Airport,Didn't there used to be a hotel INSIDE the airport terminal?  I swear I spent a night there a few years back.  I have a 10 hour layover and dont want to leave the airport unless I must.  Anyone with advice?,2
International Airport,"Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport needs to get their 💩 together! They have oved 400 people packed in line to go through customs and there’s no social distancing, no ventilation..WTH!",2
AZM,half of the rides werent even running and bout half of the concession stands were open ....for the price it cost my family and I to get in ...i wasnt worth it...we stayed about 4hrs and left ...wont be back,2
International Airport,"My least favorite airport. Secretly took off my COVID mask in the airport bathroom stall so I could finally breathe some fresh air. Heavenly... [Pics not included as all the toilets had excrement or urine on them, which begs the question after using a few Atlanta bathrooms, do people there not know how to not pee on the seats?]",2
AZM,Paid a lot for so little . But loved the staff they were awesome .,2
Theme Park,"Very short! Little value for expensive ticket. No reason to stand in line & pay! The mirrors were OK, just a small section of a medium sized building.",2
Theme Park,Short game with poor instructions from staff! Very little value for the amount of money spent.,2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Parking was difficult.

Theme Park,Most of the rides were closed. They no longer have the misting fans.,2
AZM,"when you wait extra long for the back row, but some dude from row 11 takes your seat…",2
International Airport,Wondering why so many restaurants and food shops either aren't open or are closing early.,2
Aquarium,"Overcrowded. For a business requiring reservations to prevent overcrowding, it failed. It could have been an amazing experience, but too much pushing. Also, have to pass a sad excuse of a security check. For the price....not really work it.",2
Theme Park,"Typical overpriced amusement park. We went on a Monday and about half the restaurants were closed, so not many selections for vegetarians",2
Theme Park,All the good views of the carvings are fenced off. This place is pretty much of a let down since the last time that I was here.,2
International Airport,"Clean bathrooms, fast train to/from rental cars, reasonable tsa lines, all the restaurants are closed by 8pm, except McDonald's and the newspaper stand on terminal E.",2
International Airport,"The woes and inconsistency of TSA, yet again 🤬 Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport",2
International Airport,Starbucks isn't open yet. Need stores,2
International Airport,With all that beautify that there doing its still congested. To even drop off are pick up someone,2
Museum,"I love it, i thought it was going to be boring but it was super fun lost of things to do and i didn't have to wait in line that long.",2
Zoo,"Not impressed at all.  Unfriendly staff, signs and directions to exhibits unclear or nonexistent.  We have been to Pittsburgh Zoo, Cleveland Zoo, San Diego Zoo and other smaller ones across the country that far outdid Cincinnati in every aspect.",2
Theme Park,Couldn't really enjoy your self because there was way way to many people and the worker's at the food booths were to busy talking then taking care of customer's that were standing in line for about a hour in 100 degree weather.,2
Theme Park,"Gold Card Member
Love Dollywood, disappointed in being a gold member , lost my card had to pay $15 to replace and $25 to park and was told they wouldn't reimburse, so even before walking in the park spent $40 which was ridiculous.  Lesson learned don't lose  your Gold Card.",2
Museum,I've been to several wax museums.  Moist of them looked like a little similar to the subjects.  The hair work was very off.,2
AZM,"We went to kentuckykingdom yesterday and one of my favorite parts of the park was this vintage creepy carousel, I wish i could have this thing in my house",2
Theme Park,Poor and slow service. We paid 40 dollars to get non existent pictures. Nobody at picture locations. Long and uncomfortable waits for rides. Some rides wernt even active. Definitely not worth the 6 hours of walking and money.,2
International Airport,"Bring your own FOOD. All eateries and stores open late & close early except in A concourse. No food on most flights and no food in most concourses, so bring something with you.",2
Theme Park,"This picture pretty much sums up most of the park.  Huge lines for food because most outlets were closed.  Rides not operating or broken,  some closed early.   Disappointing day for sure.",2
Theme Park,"After paying the $20 to park, we got through the parking lot only to find that they wouldn't let us in because the park was at full capacity and ""no"" you cannot get the money back. Would have been nice if they had told us that when we first got to the park.",2
Aquarium,"Im an adult with no children, went with my sister and her kids. I thought it was a waste of $40 ticket and $10 to park. Hippos need a much larger space. Very unfair to them. Saw child height outlet with no cover on it.",2
International Airport,"Quite frankly, I found it to be dirty.",2
AZM,Close to early and the many free drinks spots to much earlier 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼,2
Theme Park,This place is more of a flea market than an amusement park. 20 stores before the first ride.,2
Museum,Seems like a giant arcade with some science experiments here and there. Not for anybody over the age of 13.,2
International Airport,"I try to avoid this connection. Crowded, over booked, typically delays, dirty even during COVID-19 travel. Sanitizer dispensers empty, visible debris on floors. Staff nice and doing best without enough personnel.",2
Theme Park,"We only did the maze of mirrors. NOT worth the price for just this attraction. It was over before we knew it!  Maybe okay if adding onto wax museum visit , but don't go just for this!",2
Theme Park,Unless you're young and still ride the roller coasters it wasn't worth the $80 to me. You're better off going to Six Flags - at least the water park is included,2
International Airport,Maybe it was Delta and not the airport but we walked that airport three times before the correct gate was announced.,2
International Airport,"My only concern is there is no where to sit, when waiting on someone that is arriving 🛬. I had to stand up for an hour while I was waiting,",2
Museum,Way to pricey for what it was. Thought there would be more upside down attractions but only lobby and outside where upside down.,2
Zoo,"I’d recommend you stay far away from this zoo Most disrespectful employees I’ve ever experienced at a zoo to guests and each other especially in the
Giraffe feeding area and gift shop at the main entrance Need to set up enclosures so animals can be viewed Total waste of money and time",2
Museum,"Tickets are quite expensive for what it is, even with a $5 military discount. It's definitely catered towards kids less than 10 years old. I was disappointed because I was hoping for something more along the lines of what the Smithsonian air and space museum is like.",2
AZM,The staircases have posters which caught my attention so I fell down the stairs and sprained my ankle. Now I can't workout for at least a week.,2
Theme Park,A lot of the shops and eating shops were closed and some of the main rides to payed full admission price,2
International Airport,Was on standby flight kept getting  bumped from 1st flight to last flight. Never reached my destination 😒,2
Aquarium,"It was wayyyy too packed! I felt like I wasted my money, because we rushed through. Also, the mix of no mask & mask made me uncomfortable.",2
Museum,"The museum itself was nice, but their lack of care towards the accuracy of information is regrettable. You’d think an educational institution such as a museum would take care to spellcheck their exhibits. Found multiple misspelling on country names, very simple things to catch.",2
Water park,Wave pool is weak.   Lines got way to long right away.    Didnt stay long.,2
Theme Park,"Friendly staff, but for some reason they want to keep the lines long. I guess to keep people in the park, and to pay for fast passes. A huge dollar coaster with one car running. Also the trams during the day , how about more than one.",2
Aquarium,I did pet a shark at the aquarium however it wasn't what I expected! And parking is very bad especially for the disabled or handicapped children there is no handicap parking!,2
Theme Park,"We got ""DUCKED"" at  Dollywood!

#duckduckjeep #themejeep #jurassicparkjeep",2
Theme Park,"Let down
My family visited yesterday. The roller coasters were fun. The wait wasn't too bad. The staff were friendly. If you plan on going for the food. Don't go as the main food attractions are not available at  this time. No staff due to covid.",2
Aquarium,"A lot of attractions were closed after 6pm, so try to find a spot before noon if u are planning to go",2
Airport,"Shuttle was late and then passed us saying they were full when the whole front was open. By the time we got to the terminal, checked our bags and got through TSA, we missed our flight.",2
Aquarium,Definitely make sure you comb through the entire website. It is very difficult to find because they do not have the information clearly displayed when purchasing your tickets but they do not offer refunds for any circumstances. Such as deployment out of country 🤣,2
Sports,"Spent a night in Atlanta: walked around the centennial Olympic park, rode the sky view, and went to the Georgia aquarium. IT WAS GORGEOUS. (Pictures don’t do it justice)",2
Airport,Limited food options unless you only want burgers or chicken tenders,2
International Airport,"Definitely not the best communicate between gate employees and passengers. The gate checkers talk directly into the microphone, sounding like someone from Charlie brown and it's extremely difficult to understand them.",2
AZM,It’s better than nothing. But just barely. Staff is unfriendly.  Restaurants are dirty. Food is over priced. One of the drink stations had no ice. The water park side was better than the amusement park side. But neither are worth the trip. Avoid unless there’s just nothing else to do.,2
Theme Park,A lot of rides were closed. Lines took twice as long.,2
Museum,Not really worth the money!  If you've never been to one maybe but if you've seen one you've seen em all!! Nothing special,2
Airport,"Flight delayed for takeoff.   Inattentive flight attendants throughout flight.   Cold on the flight.  Entire group of passengers told incorrect location to pick up luggage. Just felt generally disorganized from the beginning. However, it is one of the cleanest airports I’ve been in!",2
International Airport,Crowed!  Resterants long lines. No seats anywhere.,2
Theme Park,"Was disappointed. Seemed a bit dated and run down for the money you pay. The park was clean and more wholesome than  the Gatlinburg scene, so that was good, but things just aren't the quality of the Old Silver Dollar City days.",2
International Airport,Asked for help from several employees and incorrect directions given. Too big for small-towner like me.,2
International Airport,No place to eat after 5 but McDonald's.  Everything closed.,2
Theme Park,"Let down
Just visited Dollywood. The rides were fun. The lines weren't too long. Staff were friendly. I was really let down that most food attractions were not available due to covid low staffing.",2
Zoo,Map of the zoo was confusing. Gift shop lacks a good selection of t shirts. A lot of animals were inside due to heat. Been nice to see them in their inside habitat. Staff in the barnyard area was rude to my special needs son. They need sensitivity training and have understanding of ADA.,2
International Airport,"Too big, no food options because shops close early, outlets don't work. If you can avoid this airport do so, go to Minneapolis airport or something.",2
International Airport,It might be the world's busiest airport but nothing is open at 7:30pm on a Sunday night.  If it's the world's busiest then why is everything shut down.  Not to mention vending machines are empty.  Excellent Sunday night at the airport in ATL 👎,2
Aquarium,SeaWorld Adventure best place to take the little one,2
International Airport,"Come on! It's been 20 years since 9/11 and the security process is still so erratic and degrading and this 'pay for shorter lines' is just making everyone crazy!Then, what is this CNN thing? We just had to endure your security fun and now we have to listen to FAKE NEWS.  You're sucking all the fun out of travel!",2
Zoo,Just meh. Much better zoos out there. Things seemed very small for most animals and very disappointed for such a larger city.,2
International Airport,"Weather delays ! Glad our crew kept us informed a lot , makes a difference .",2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) It's too tight

Theme Park,"was fun, but they need to get their 💩 together. Headliner ride broken down, no food places open. Pay your employees more so they want to work there!",2
Theme Park,Sad beautiful park but nothing open for food waited an hour for a hot dog… gift shops wide open with staff first time here not a great experience,2
Theme Park,"A lot of shops, vendors, demonstrations and shows were closed.. which is the reason we went 😒",2
International Airport,The airport is bad as usual. Good luck trying to find somewhere to eat with out a long line or wait time,2
Zoo,"Beautiful greenery but for the $ a bit short on animals. No lions, birds, reptiles, no hippos, giraffes, and only one kind of monkey",2
Theme Park,"Rides are like any other theme park but the majority of the food places were closed.  Because the park was so crowded, everyone had to go to the same few open places for food which were by the entrance and those lines were longer than the ride lines.  Timesaver passes were sold out.",2
International Airport,"The airport itself was really nice and easy to navigate. However my plane landed at 7:30 and most food options were closed. Those that were open, had a line a mile long. The website hours for restaurants is not accurate.",2
Theme Park,Poor layout. Had to wait 40 minutes to get a hotdogs and fries. Over half the places to eat were not open due to not enough staff to run them. 👎,2
Aquarium,"Far too crowded during covid. Mask obviously not required, but recommended. Food was crazy expensive... eat before you go.",2
International Airport,"Lots of construction going on, lots of changes.
My ATL is gone now .",2
Airport,"SAC METRO AIRPORT NEEDS TO FIX THEIR SCALE FOR CUSTOMERS TO WEIGH THEIR OWN LUGGAGE... WE  WEIGHED OUR LUGGAGE, THEN THE UNITED STAFF WEIGH THE SAME LUGGAGE & IT WEIGHED 30LBS LESS... THAT GAVE US A $200 REFUND, SMH....",2
Theme Park,"Over crowded on a weekday, I understand that this is a tourist attraction and everyday is like a weekend (post COVID-19). They were under staffed and I get that, so stop letting so many people in.",2
Zoo,We went early so we caught noisy of the animals starting their day. But not many animals to see.,2
Theme Park,"Hot and not that much fun
I just didn't like it and maybe you might enjoy going. Just a lot of restaurants and shops. I think they could have more rides.",2
Theme Park,One complaint was the availability of soft drinks. Had to walk quite a bit to find when at back of park. This likely due to staffing after Covid and ongoing extra unemployment,2
Museum,"Too many people allowed in at once, so we could not experience everything.   Disappointed with the money spent.",2
International Airport,"Okay, so I like this airport except that everything is closed and I have an hour and a half before my flight takes off. So I'm just sitting here hungry and bored. Like 9pm is not that late y'all. At the very least you would expect one place to be open since they would legit be the only place to get food at after 9pm. Anyways the train is fun.",2
International Airport,All food stores and convenient stores are closed by by 9pm except McDonald's and that closes at 10. No place to get even a bottle of water.,2
Theme Park,Looking forward to this trip for a long time wanting to go to Dollywood but I found out that it is very very expensive.,2
Museum,"I was being generous with the 2 stars.
Employees were not pleasant.
Very few figures were lifelike.
Weren’t taking cards. WHO carries cash anymore?.
Waste of money.",2
International Airport,Airport is dated and needs to be updated to fit the needs of passengers it has no charging stations for any electronic devices and restrooms need to be cleaned and sanitized to match the traffic of incoming and departing flights food courts also need a better schedule so patrons can buy food all times of the day,2
International Airport,Too many passengers in the large airport.  Train over crowded .  Many stores never reopened due to COVID-19,2
International Airport,"The signage needs to be clearer and more precise, to give better driving directions.",2
Theme Park,Dollywood has lost its country music charm.  Gone are the days of hearing Dolly singing throughout the park.  Hardly any water rides left.  Just isn’t that fun anymore.,2
International Airport,Need simpler directions from domestic to international,2
Museum,Some of the people didn't even look like the people that they were supposed to be.,2
Airport,"Terrible! We got to terminal C with barely enough time to eat something before the connection, but there were no open restaurants! So there we were, a family of four getting junk food from a vending machine after not being fed by the airline either.",2
Airport,Crowded and crowd diversion makes no sense,2
Aquarium,Not enough to see for the high prices. Go on your birthday...it's free.,2
Theme Park,"Unfortunately, it was underwhelming. The shops didn't really have much to offer. There were only two places to sit down and eat that were open. One of the water rides was down. My family really looked forward to our trip, but we were disappointed.",2
AZM,"The facility itself is very nice, but it was a shame that there were many selfish Chinese children.",2
Theme Park,"Spent the entire day there. Felt like a wasted day. Most the rides were either down for maintenance, or because lightning was spotted the next county over. Only good things were the cinnamon bread and coal train.",2
Airport,"More signage about how far car rentals are from main terminal.  No one explained about sky trains.  Traveling with young kids, all the walking was a pain.",2
Aquarium,I last visited the aquarium 20 years ago. It has gotten fairly dated and needs a big update.,2
Airport,Disappointed that not a single coffee place was open air side around 4 pm on a Saturday. Also closed Jamba Juice and Corner Bakery :(,2
Museum,I think its a bit over priced especially for kids as there is not much kids want to see or do in the museum. I hadn't been inside the last few years I came and not much have changed in the over 5 years since I last went. Anyone over the age of 11 has to pay adult price which is ridiculous.,2
Museum,"I expected more…There are a few pieces of equipment, uniforms, space suits and tools….very poor and abandoned…mmm…",2
Museum,"This experience is not worth the ticket price. It is interesting but they should add more figures. I enjoyed the props and that it is tactile.  They also need better, more relevant souvenirs",2
AZM,"Horribly slow and grumpy ride ops, rides close 15 minutes before park does(imagine stealing time from your paying customers) crowds are rude, park is dirty and gross. Free drinks are nice. At least I got my storm chaser credit. No wonder six flags abandoned this park.",2
Theme Park,This place they have pump a lot of money it's a nice place at best I thought it was pricey  I would skip this place if I new in advance...,2
Museum,some of the celebrities really need repair or replacement. I was so disappointed that the one person I wanted to see head was broken- Marilyn Monroe not to mention the statue didn't even look like her. it's time for them to do some cleaning and upkeep especially for the money being spent.,2
AZM,"Not worth the admission this time of the year, several slides closed as well as roller coasters.  Ridiculous prices for be beverages and food compared to Holiday World.  Doesn't come close to competing with them unfortunately.",2
Airport,"Not a big fan of the customs area and security for international connected return flights, maybe it's because of the Covid-19 situation. This is a lot worse.",2
AZM,They was no bears and very few animals out.  Waited a hr on food and the lady didn't even put our order in and we paid over 60$,2
AZM,For one it said aquarium and the boardwalk it it wasn’t open and we paid for both. And two there was to many people what’s the point in seeking a time to go if there’s gonna be a lot of people.,2
Airport,"Somewhat annoyed this evening on ride to terminal from economy parking lot. Noticed the driver was quick to inquire if the young black man entering the bus had a face mask; but at the next stop when two young women boarded without mask, the driver did not ask. The women only placed a mask after my husband and I looked at them. The driver never inquired.",2
Airport,Plenty of food options except in the morning.  And the Starbucks is awful.,2
Theme Park,"Alot of things were shut down, when your paying full price its definitely a let down",2
Airport,I had 1hr and 45 minutes to make connection from international flight.   Just made it even  Though I had to go through TSA twice.   No fun...,2
Theme Park,"Not Handling Crowds
Went to the park August 11th. Super crowded. Almost an hour to clear security. 45 minute line for any kind of food. 45 minutes to an hour for most large rides.  Need to handle crowds better. Need to open more seating areas to sit and eat.     Buildings look nice and well kept.",2
AZM,"There were animals that were kept alone, most exhibits weren't big enough, not enough places to pick up a drink along the way. I was disappointed.",2
AZM,Not worth the price. $33 per adult and took maybe 30-40 minutes to go through. Save your money for the aquarium at Bass Pro in Springfield. You will spend 2-3 hours or more looking at everything there.,2
Airport,"The customs line needs to have all employees working not just 5 agents working.  If all the customs lines were opened, the lrocess would go by quickly and people wouldn't miss their flights and be able to get food to eat before flight takws off.",2
Airport,Just wondering why a 24 hour airport wouldn't keep the food stands open 24 hours,2
Aquarium,"they refused to change their discriminatory disability policies. As a science teacher who loved to come here this hurts to say, but I will not step foot here until my partner and all others are able to see the inside with me.",2
Water park,Security line was SO long. The place was packed! My son didn't enjoy it like I had hoped.,2
Water park,"Expensive for how small the park is( $50 for a day pass and $10 for lockers). There are about seven rides, nothing crazy. It smells very bad in some parts of the park.",2
Zoo,Disappointing.  The restaurants were not open. Wanted a nice meal but that to leave the park to get it. We had 7 people with us with 4 children who got cranky cause they were hungry.  That made us a unpleasant situation.,2
Theme Park,"We are Dolly fans, but I got to say the park was kinda a let down , price is very high to park and to get in and most of food places were not open , we wore our mask and they cramed as many people as possible on the train.they did not practice social distancing.it was all about the money.",2
Aquarium,"Probably too much was expected from this aquarium. After Seoul, there were not such enthusiasm here anymore",2
Airport,"There airport and it's facilities are not big enough to accommodate the amount of travelers flying thru that airport. Additionally, the facilities were too small to accommodate travelers requirements, restrooms, restaurant and seating areas",2
Aquarium,"Long day & long walk.  So tired.

At Shedd Aquarium in Chicago",2
Airport,People not knowledgeable and the lines are way too long. Not an effective procure.,2
Zoo,Fife start for park there start for zoo. Poor selection of animals.,2
Aquarium,Extremely crowded. Over priced. Purchase tickets online before you get there.  Bathrooms were clean. Face mask are required to enter the Aquarium.,2
Airport,Same old ATL as pre-covid now. Bunch of Delta gate agents with an attitude.,2
Airport,Need signs that are more visible. Took me 20 minutes to find check-in area. Was given wrong directions by airport employees.,2
Airport,"Busiest airport in the country...to bad all the restaurants close at 6pm. Nothing but long lines, or dim lights. Dumbest thing ever.",2
Airport,Not a lot of shops or food places open. Really sad!,2
Airport,No restaurants open on a Sunday evening. Dinner consisted of a $12 pack of beef jerky and a bottle of soda. So much for being the busiest airport in the US,2
Airport,"This is just a comment solely for the economy lot. You HAVE TO arrive a minimum 30 mins ahead of your schedule if you're going to use it. They don't have enough bus drivers so it's really hard to not have your luggage deemed late even if you arrive 1.5 hours early. This is even on days where they're not busy. It must be a budget thing. It's consistently like this, so get used to it.",2
Aquarium,I visited the aquarium when it first opened and now today.  It has changed a lot.  There was not a lot to see and whole building was packed full.  You couldn't walk with bumping into people. I don't think it's safe for young children.,2
AZM,There where not a lot of animals to see and the ones we could see looked exhausted and they where not even moving.,2
Airport,"Big and spread out. All their foot traffic criss-crosses and goes through tight spaces. I was not impressed with the plane train. Kitchens are all understaffed, do not expect to eat there after 7pm.",2
Zoo,Most of the animals were singles. I wasn't impressed,2
Aquarium,"Very commercialized. Tickets are expensive and it cost at least 10 bucks to park. Despite all the hype about this aquarium, I didn't find it meeting my expectations. I have been in better aquariums both in the states and overseas, and they weren't nearly as commercialized as this one.",2
Theme Park,Beautiful park but severely scared 😨 by the Confederate symbolism in the mountain.,2
Theme Park,It's a family tradition! Ive been going here since I was little and so has my mom and grandparents. They always have friendly staff and a family friendly environment. Would recommend to anyone! I love the many options of rides for all ages! My 5 and 2 yr old had a blast!,2
Zoo,"Never have animals out and everything is
Insanely priced. Better to take food",2
Museum,"Sorry to say we are not very happy. Wanted to see the Red Pandas, we were told, no problem they would be available. Checked again yesterday and told the same. We drove 200 miles, no Red Pandas to be seen.
Wasted time and money.",2
Airport,"Give me: people I’m not surprised to see disobeying the mask mandate at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport for $500, Alex!

Hint: it’s that wacko lady on the right that gives GA a bad name..",2
Water park,Major rides closrd down. Didn't leave a big selection,2
Garden,Some of the exhibits look abandoned. Restaurants are hard to find. Some of the exhibits closed at 2 pm and their restaurants closed at 3 pm.  Confusing pathways once you're inside and it just looked deserted. The butterfly garden was nice but too small.,2
Airport,All restaurants closed at 8:00pm.  It was a Tuesday night.,2
Aquarium,"It's so sad, several fish and mammals in captivity in small spaces. I saw a turtle go around in circles over and over again.  They are not made to live locked up ... like us, they need space and freedom.",2
Aquarium,Was highly disappointed in the price to only see fish seals and otters. Not worth the price.,2
Aquarium,Total disappointment... price increased over the years   however entertainment got reduced to a level that was no more fun to kids...no more whales..no dolphins....just seals and fishes..plus the awful attitude of certain  staff members at the gate...will not recommended...,2
Museum,"It was pretty lackluster. The exhibits seemed tossed together without much thought. I was expecting way way more. I loved it here as a kid, now it just seems sad.",2
Airport,"crazy traffic. all the lanes coned off, cant get over to drop off..",2
Airport,Slow and seems overwhelmed to handle passenger travel efficiently in regards to international transfer.,2
Airport,"Great food, very clean. Only one star because since my last visit, all smoking areas have been permanently closed. I shouldn't have to go through security just to smoke.",2
Airport,Takes to long to get to baggage claim,2
Zoo,Thought it was dirty in areas and disappointed not seeing  alot of the animals.,2
Airport,On the way down wheelchair assistance was not immediately available and a bit nerve wracking for timely boarding. On the way back-much better.,2
Airport,Needs more food vendors in terminal F,2
Airport,"Chilling on the floor at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport still waiting for our flight to leave THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE AT 9:25 LAST NIGHT! Anyway, it's fine I guess. My first experience with Delta has been wonderful. NOT!",2
AZM,If you are a bigger person even a little bit then you can forget riding anything.,2
Aquarium,Social distancing is not possible. It is irrelevant to have an appointment.,2
Theme Park,Over priced admission... A lot of stuff closed down,2
Museum,Didn't enter because you can't see what you are paying for. Have to be tall enough to do rides. Slightly expensive have to pay even if you don't do any rides or attractions,2
Museum,"Ok experience,to be honest there wasn't a huge amount of activities for the price of the ticket. Wouldn't recommend it",2
Zoo,Definitely needs some cleaning up. Plants all over grown and hanging over the fence blocking the paths. Not many animals out either. Disappointed.,2
Airport,Easy enough to navigate but WHY are all the food establishments besides McDonalds & Arby’s closed by 7:00pm??  There were probably 40 people in line at McD’s and we only had 30 minutes between our flights to get something to eat. Literally the only thing left was a cold ham & cheese sandwich for $10 from the C-store. The airport was still plenty busy with no shops or dining open. SMH….,2
Museum,Kennedy Space Center is 100% better so Houston we have a problem!,2
Airport,The lack of charging places is annoying and the fact that almost everything is closed by 6 is also annoying but other than that it's fine.,2
Airport,All the shops restaurants closed at 8:45pm.... Had tons of people in the C Concourse.....,2
Airport,"They are understaffed, simply put.",2
Airport,I know we’re in a pandemic but almost every restaurant/store was closed. Waiting in an airport with not even a place to buy a bottled water was soooo annoying.,2
AZM,Didnt see enough animals it was to hot. I didnt get my zoo bucks,2
Airport,Why is the airport speaker this loud😭. We have earplugs in our ears it’s that loud Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,2
Theme Park,"This place is WAY overpriced for what you get. No complimentary breakfast, everything is overpriced in this place. The rooms are just ok. It’s nice for a hotel. Mediocre for a resort. I won’t stay there again.",2
Airport,There were NO USB charging ports anywhere around our gate. There were some seats with them underneath but the ports were gutted and none worked. Charging phones is critical is you want us to go paperless.,2
Airport,"On this visit I was in terminal a changing to a connecting flight. Not bad
My only complaint all the food places were closed except 1 that every hungry traveler was waiting in line. And the area could use a few more flight status boards.",2
Aquarium,The downside is that there is free parking outside and it is far away.,2
Airport,"You have to take the smoking areas out of the map, very confuse.",2
Museum,Denver museum is a fantastic place to see.  Our visit was disappointing. The dinosaur display was closed off as were a few other areas.  What happened to doing repairs and cleaning after public viewing?  Made no sense 😐,2
Airport,Odd many of the food establishments were closed (or maybe just restocking?) At 530- 600 pm.,2
Museum,Wish that there weren't so many extra cost exhibits,2
Theme Park,Yellow jackets are horrible!!!  Dollywood needs to spray!  2 of us got stung and we were worried about baby and toddler with us being stung as well. Definitely negatively impacted our experience.  Went to first aid station after being stung and were 8th or 9th on list with bee stings.,2
Theme Park,"A lot of the rides were down for maintenance. And the Geronimo is closed ""because no social distancing.""",2
Aquarium,The movement is a bit disappointing and the performance time is a bit jumbled.,2
Zoo,"A Sad Zoo
This is a very sad zoo. It really should be updated or closed. They have one lonely elephant which should be put in a sanctuary with other elephants.  There is not much to see here. Woodland Park zoo is a much better choice.",2
Theme Park,I wasn't that impressed with it but then again I couldn't ride the rides.,2
Theme Park,We wanted to go eat lunch and shop in the Crossroads Village area. They wouldn't let us in without a $30 armband. Then I heard that almost everything was closed.,2
Airport,Rental place opens at 6am but no one shows up til half past whenever they feel like it,2
Museum,Ropes Courses were good. Employee working on the ropes course was a complete jerk.,2
Theme Park,Several rides weren't running. Lots of walking to get to the rides. Wish that you could get to the water park from the theme park. Also it's only open from 10 to 7 and some rides have an hour wait.,2
Airport,"Restaurant info on the delta app for this airport doesn't have accurate store hours for Restaurants. Many say open till 10 but actually close at 6. Certainly a challenge tp grab food when you think you're arriving to a gate with choices,  but all are closed.",2
AZM,"Total let down!
For the amount of money I paid and the size of the building I really expected more. We were in and out so fast, I couldn’t believe it.",2
Airport,Nothing is open to eat past 8pm,2
AZM,the teenagers working there are all so rude... half the rides weren't open for my small grandbabies to ride.. and even the bigger rides were closed too.. good thing I don't come too often cause it was a big disappointment today..,2
Airport,I was on concourse C and all the restaurants had closed at 8:00 for some reason except for two and the line was out of site..,2
Theme Park,I've been herr pre covid and loved it. This time it seemed understaffed and very little demonstration of how things are made. Shops also opened haphazardly.,2
Aquarium,Its decent aquarium but not work their outrageous ticket price. Seen better aquariums in Washington Dc for free.,2
Aquarium,"Frankly, I expected more for the money. Very messy organization to begin with. The application has to be re-vamped so that the reservations were reflected right on the main page... Messy IT.",2
Aquarium,"(Translated by Google) Not very good

(Original)
No muy bueno",2
Museum,"I wish i would of known about the times on the shuttle, drove 4 hrs to hear sorry we are already all booked... spend over 100 on going in...",2
Museum,Stop with the face masks. It's 100° out and you have to wear a mask on an outdoor tour. Get real. We got sick from heat exhaustion and not being able to breathe properly.,2
Museum,"Pretty badly organized for a place so remarkable. Everything's just there, there's just no sense of direction or proper flow. Not bad for a first visit but definitely no repeat value.",2
Airport,Aiight to get through. Really tough with a 2 hr layover to have so few restaurants and bars open at 8pm. Only 1 oriental restaurant was open with 30 in line. No restaurant or bars open concourse C.,2
Zoo,Only downfall is certain animals are shown on different days,2
Airport,9:15 only 1 food place open!!!! Starbucks is the only one! Had to make a 70 minute line. Terrible.,2
Airport,Could be better shopping not like that’s what I need to be doing ….,2
Aquarium,Directions. Bad frome parting lot. Walkway need arrows.,2
AZM,Was lacking signs in zoo to know what directions exhibits were. Some unfriendly staff as well! Was an ok zoo. Hard to see some animals in exhibits as well.,2
Airport,"Service was pretty bad and the food
selection was minimal.",2
Aquarium,"Disappointed with Covid precaution.
Too many people with no social distancing and some people are not compliant with mask policy. I don't see the point of making appointment to visit this aquarium. I can see that some people could get the infection from this place.",2
Airport,Arrived from key west just after 7pm. Poor selection of food available for such a large airport.,2
Museum,It was pretty dirty. Staff was ok. Several of the game machines were broken.,2
Zoo,"Sad Denver zoo
No polar bears, no wolves, just one lion and numerous  other closed cages.  New sting ray exhibit charged.   We will not be going back.",2
Airport,The bathrooms are filthy not all but should be checked regularly,2
Aquarium,"(Translated by Google) extravagant

(Original)
별루임",2
Zoo,It felt so dead. Not really much going on like years ago. Iguess covids in the air. Not much to see,2
Garden,Not worth the money.  Rooms were not cleaned.  Carpets were dirty and stained.  Not much service at all.  Driving range at the golf course had no balls available.  This place is going down the tubes.,2
Museum,"Only 2 Stars based on the fact that tours were cancelled for unknown reasons.  (Weather was not a factor.)
As a result exhibition was very crowded.

I would even say, non-acceptable for Covid times.

Reimbursement of ticket price was not offered. Even after asking.....",2
Theme Park,Not like it used to be with more crafters showing how they do their crafts.,2
AZM,Didn't have all rides going because had little staff working,2
Museum,"Not what we expected
This was not our first visit to a wax museum.  However, we were somewhat disappointed.  It was hard to tell who many of the figures were supposed to be...definitely needed to read the signs next to each of them.",2
Airport,I transported cans of beer in my checked luggage from Atlanta to St Louis tonight to provide to a charity Silent auction.   Someone selectively stole 7 beers from my checked luggage.   I could not be more disappointed that this charity will not be able to fully benefit from our gift because of thieves!!!!!,2
AZM,The place is very cool but the price to me wasn't worth it. A fun Saturday there is $65 and adult with the cheapest day being $45. There's tons of aquariums for under $20. Tulsa OK is the same distance for us and it's really fun and it's bigger. We go there once a year and it's always worth it.,2
Airport,Immigration queues and process ease was a pain. It took >75min to arrive Intl in Term F and go to Term A where I had to get straight onto the flight being one of the last to board!,2
Airport,Slow service. Took too long to get to airport,2
Airport,"Delta check-in was horrible. After getting to checkpoint the e-tickets disappeared. When we were escorted out of line the boarding passes came back up, but we were sent all the way back to the beginning to start over instead of scanning the one missing pass. Worst check-in process I ever had getting through security",2
Airport,"No A/C in TSA north or on the train. Great for anemics, but everyone else was suffering.",2
Airport,This has been my favorite airport in the USA for years but flew through there 2 days ago. Landed on a connection at 9:30PM and ALL shops/restaurants/retailers were closed. I was hungry/thirsty with no luck except a long line waiting for a bank of vending machines.,2
Airport,"Not the worst airport in America, but the general quality of the airline staffs, the gross restaurants, and the congested terminals puts it in the lower ranks.  The airline clubs are overstuffed, the lines for food in the terminal are miles long, and the bathrooms smell like sh** and have dirty paper towels covering the counters and floors.  If you have a choice, fly or connect elsewhere.",2
Airport,"Don’t have early flights, you will never find food. And when they do finally open around 0630-7
0700 the lines are so long you better have an hour minimal to wait for food. You would think as a busy airport food would be open for customers and to make some money.",2
Museum,A little high on prices. None of the hand sanitizer stations worked. Animals need more shade outside than they have.,2
Airport,Baggage is slower than ever and TSA has to many employees giving directions,2
Museum,"Not worth the money.  Able to take pictures of all the wax figures but not King Kong,  why???? The other attractions not very good. Won't be going back!!",2
Theme Park,The only negative about this place was the hills. Old people + climbing hills = complete exhaustion.,2
Aquarium,"The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable, but for the location and considering there are really not many aquariums worth a visit nearby, the attractions/exhibits could and should be improved.",2
Airport,"Fix your tram!

Frequent flyer here and every evening (9-11pm) I get back from a trip over the last 3-4 months your tram has not been working. Seems like a personnel issue or shift change for it to be this consistent.",2
Airport,Over half the restaurants were closed at lunch time.  Security line was ridiculously long and they only had two lanes out of 6 open (not sure if they are competing walmart).  Staff was nice and pleasant.,2
Aquarium,The online booking system somehow doesn’t work. The walk in tickets are $4 more expensive per person.,2
Theme Park,Made it to the top of Stone Mountain!⛰ Woo-hoo!! It sucks because the restaurant was closed and couldn't even get a drink of water because the water fountain was turned off!!!! 😫,2
Airport,I used to enjoy Alt. Heartsfield. Half the restaurants closed. Everyone herded to the food courts. COVID-19 station.,2
Aquarium,"I would save your time and money and skip this aquarium. The exhibits are small, it's not clean, all the glass is dirty and the 4D show was short and smelled awful, like mildew and BO. The whole thing including the show took us 40 min to go through.",2
Airport,"I was fine until they took my toothpaste and hair products and told. Then told me that I could go check with the airline to see if I could bring it. That means I would have to walk back to the front, then come back to get checked in with tsa and I was already pushing it to catch my flight.",2
Airport,"Poor, shops were closed and nothing to eat was open. At noon!!!",2
Theme Park,Way to expensive. For what you pay to get in and all the things in is really expensive. The only reason I gave it a 2 star is how they honor the military.,2
Zoo,I was kind of disappointed in the zoo was not very clean....,2
AZM,It's OK but the one in Springfield MO its way better.,2
Airport,One person running the bar during peak time.,2
Airport,"One of the dirtiest, most confusing airports I've been in. And it's definitely not  ""pandemic"" friendly.  Everyone gets herded through the same small hallways and the same escalator and then packed into their monorail like sardines. Too many people fly through here for it's size.  TSA area is also small and the bins are disgusting.",2
Museum,"You need to take the train. Otherwise you miss out, however.... I won't go back until they drop the mask mandate. Seriously, 100+ degree is no joke! Heat stroke is more common than covid in those conditions",2
Museum,We were expecting more wax figures for the price we paid. BE AWARE THAT THIS IS A PLACE THAT WILL RING A GROUP OF TWO OR MORE PEOPLE  UP SEPARATELY TO GET MORE SALES TAX.,2
Airport,Nothing is open for early Flights,2
Theme Park,"I liked the new fun Halloween things, but something has to be done about the concessions. Waiting in line for half an hour to just get water and bad service. They don't have food we want or we couldn't pay because the machine is down. Just makes for a bad and irritating trip.",2
Airport,WHY DOES IT SEEM LIKE EVERYWHERE THAT HAS FOOD IS CLOSED BY 8:30???? Got off a flight from Vegas hungry and had nowhere to get any food!!!,2
Theme Park,"We went on a Thursday, 1/4 to 1/3  of the attraction were closed 😒",2
Theme Park,"(Translated by Google) Wifi did not work

(Original)
No funcionaba el wifi",2
Theme Park,Rides and theme park we had a good time. When it came to food. Food options and quality could have been better.  Service was horrible too.  Management needs to keep a better eye on this area.,2
Airport,"Dear Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport - you brag that youre the busiest airport in the world, so you know that you should hire more security and baggage people to handle the load.  AND you probably also know that you should offer employees a course in social skills. #hartsfieldjackson #AtlantaAirport #rudeness #HOME",2
Airport,10AM no where to get a cocktail 🍸!!,2
Theme Park,Pretty place but a lot of walking and the map is very confusing should be redone it's hard to find any of the shows what starts where and you get lost I really was not impressed sorry,2
Airport,By far one of the worst airports to travel through. You can find plenty of alcohol but very few decent food options. Staff are rude and flights change without notice.,2
AZM,"The stop was very friendly, however there wasn't really much to see forced you worth $40 after taxes for just one person. It was an extremely small aquarium.",2
Airport,"Good airport, but really poor parking options, and they are either expensive or hard to get back and forth to, especially the economy parking. Why isn't there mass transit to the airport?",2
Airport,"Took over 1.5 hrs to get through security, missed my flight by 2 minutes. I can get through security at JFK & Laguadia faster. Your TSA people were also rude and abrupt. This was my first trip and hopefully my last trip to Atlanta.",2
Aquarium,"Theatre safety regarding covid. 4d experience actually CUT my leg.  Some staff was great and super friendly, but most just seemed over life. The whole building was very hot, and the bathroom stalls were MUCH too small. The sea lion show (pier 225) was awesome, but over all poor quality visit.",2
Airport,If you fly in after 8 good luck finding a good place to eat!,2
AZM,All games are gone the restaurant was disgusting and half the water park was shut down,2
Airport,"Only thing I don't like is I have to remove my mask to past security. Surrounded by people, during covid. No 6 feet rules either.",2
Theme Park,"Was not happy they had closed down the water rides , eating place closed",2
Airport,"When I was leaving Hartsfield - Jackson Airport in Atlanta, Ga.  I was going through Security Check and I was a little upset at how slowly the lines were moving.  The section that I was in had 3 booths, but there was only 1 person working.  I stood in line for at least 30-40 minutes.",2
Theme Park,"BOGO lie
BOGO was basically a lie. We had to pay more once we had gotten to the park. Hoping they correct this next week after a phone call. They tried to ruin our experience, not cool.",2
Zoo,"It was ok. Need bigger walk ways, animals are never out. Just doesn't get me excited anymore",2
Aquarium,Do not believe the website.  Takes more than 4 hrs if you've never been there before.,2
Theme Park,"Should have played putt putt instead
We found Dollywood a bit disappointing, rides closed, seemed like the shows we went to were repetitive, At least the weather was nice, blue skis, temp in the low 80’s, yet seen signs saying ride closed due to inclement weather. Definitely not worth the price!",2
Theme Park,"Many food and attractions closed, although many employees were nice and helpful you had some who were so rude and disrespectful. It just wasn't worth the money this time.",2
Zoo,"well...it was packed, not many people wore a mask nor social distance themselves...I liked it better 6 months ago...",2
Aquarium,"I’d love to take my children, but gosh it’s SO expensive! Do you offer any discounts? Thanks!",2
Zoo,We saw more bunnies than actual animals. With such a beautiful day we really thought we would see more activity. The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is where we will spend our money next time.,2
Airport,Pretty aggravated over the fact this airport doesn't accommodate all people.. All I ask for after a stressful flight would be a smoking area.. plus can't find anywhere at 7pm that is open to get food that doesn't have a 30 minute wait .,2
Airport,The rating so low because not many food/drink places open for the amount of traffic. Disappointed for airport of this size.,2
Museum,As lame as one would expect. It is cheap and mildly fun.,2
Airport,They don't offer the full TSA PreCheck.. really lazy of them,2
Museum,The Boom exhibit in the main hall is way too loud for all ages.,2
Airport,"TSA was great. No one was at the airport on Saturday at 6:15 PM so I cruised right through. The only problem was that almost all the shops and restaurants were closed. Shut. Lights out!
Ended up at a bookkstore/snack shop and paid $17 for a wrapped sandwich and a diet coke. Yikes!!!😣😲",2
Airport,Long lines fo TSA but made through,2
Aquarium,Zero social distancing enforcement takes place here. Had to call and be heard to death by a member of management. Sadly we will not be renewing our annual membership.,2
Theme Park,Just not alot to do anymore. The pumpkin fest felt as if it was constructed by 10 year olds. The wizard of oz 4d was a waste of 17 minutes. Where was the color? What happened to the snow?,2
Airport,"Very unorganized.
From walking thru the the entrance to the zones loading onto the plane .
Also the unnecessary walking to the D gates. Walk you all the way one way, just to literally have you turn around and walk back the same way . As if airports aren't confusing enough.  🙄",2
Airport,Will never fly Southwest Air again.,2
AZM,Nice high quality exhibits geared primarily for children. However you can easily move through the aquarium in about half an hour. At $65/person it’s a ripoff and should be priced about $25/person.,2
Airport,My TSA approved luggage locks were removed. No  reason stated.,2
Aquarium,"9,000 won Marine Exploration Boat Don&#39;t Taj Mahal It&#39;s really narrow, give me some food",2
Attraction,"Not to much to do.
Just a quick heads up. its for small children and parents willing to wait long lines for a short ride. The part of the cities is nice, but did the BIG mistake on spending new years there and was not good at all.",2
Attraction,"Been and done it
Bit disappointing, this is my 3rd time here, Kids 14-10 loved the LEGO side but the rides were aimed at the younger aged child.Definitely out grown this place.Parking is also expensive",2
Attraction,"Save your money
All water rides (including under the sea submarine) were not only closed but disassembled, way overpriced for $70-100/day. What was opened was fun but too many rides were closed. There should be no need for reservations anymore.",2
Attraction,The main water attractions like the wave pool and the lazy river were closed.,2
Attraction,"make sure your kids know how old are they, my 4 year old kid, they didn't let him ride just because he said he's 3 when he really is 4 🙄 in fact he was taller than 36""",2
Attraction,This was a little meh for my family. Food is super expensive. We had four people. A small and depressing meal for us cost $78!?!?! Very expensive. This place would be for little kids since some rides are only for your little ones. Waits were really long as well.,2
Attraction,"Broken hotel rooms, 1/4 of rides inoperable. Lack of food seating. 1 of the two water parks closed. Lots of ride breakdowns. You would think with the park being shutdown for a year they would have done some maintenance. Won’t be back for a few years and maybe their will get their act together.",2
Attraction,"Several rides are shut down, with no disclaimer on the website!",2
Attraction,Lots of food and beverages are not open. And some of the rides are closed,2
Attraction,Very uninspired.  Think of an attempted to capture the magic of disney but reduced by 99%.,2
Attraction,"The limitations on some of the rides are a little ridiculous. If a parent can go on the ride with their child, the height requirement should be lower. All of the rides my daughter want to go on, she was 1"" to short for. It feels slightly discriminating against people who are vertical challenged.",2
Attraction,"Very outdated, alot of attractions were closed. The two hotels in front seemed more exciting.",2
Attraction,"Place was okay operators were very slow and a lot of stands were closed not many options for snacks. I guess they were short staffed from covid, but if your going to provide less I believe you should also charge less.",2
Attraction,"Music was extremely repetitive & loud, water park was fun even though the main water  slide was shut down. The splash ride was good fun in swim shorts",2
Theme Park,They need to get things in order....hire more people to operate all rides..fine tune their check in process.. 27 dollars for parking?!?,2
Theme Park,"Understaffed, many rides didn't have somebody on site",2
Theme Park,Many of the rides were shut down. Limited food options. Only had cotton candy or green apple ice cream. Bought legoland cups but when went to refill only had limited options mostly diet drinks. For the price you pay not worth it,2
Theme Park,"Not quite ""finished"" yet lots of the playgrounds are still close most of the snack places are also closed even tho it's advertised as fully open",2
Theme Park,They really need to get their act together. Second time there this year and it just isn't up to par yet.  Maybe next season.,2
Theme Park,"Very easy to get to, not all rides were open, most drink refill stations were out of order, very long lines for rides that lasted less then 1 minute. I feel its due to being new and short staffed, i would try it again next spring and maybe the kinks will be worked out by then.",2
Theme Park,Some food stands and rides were not open and there were long waits for rides even though it was at reduced capacity.,2
Theme Park,Not a lot of places that provided shade. Rides closed down even though park just opened not too long ago.,2
Theme Park,Over priced and everything is not open yet smh .... extremely long lines they need more staff,2
Theme Park,Long lines and expensive food. A lot of attractions and rides aren't open. The mini cities are the best.,2
Theme Park,Need more stairs to skip the winding long ramps at certain points,2
Theme Park,Some of the activities take so long to opened and to use the others takes to much time to wait in line,2
Theme Park,"Early work in progress,  no real landscaping.  Still does not have any kosher restaurants, which is strange since so many families that attend, keep kosher.",2
Theme Park,Legoland should hire more employees. Some rides had to close early because employees had to leave. I was there 8,2
Theme Park,"It's a nice park but there is extremely poor queue management, no shade, and extremely understaffed (e.g waiting 30+ minutes to buy ice cream).  They should sell substantially fewer tickets if they want to claim they are limiting entry to control crowds.",2
Theme Park,"Every single slushies machine they had is broken and has been for months. They have kiosks that tell you how long the waits for a ride are, but they don't update them",2
Theme Park,Why would you have two machines but only operating with one and over 1 hour long wait time. Seems like they need more people or learn how to operate a theme park. We have been here since 10:30 am and is 1 pm and have only been in 2 rides because of the crazy long lines,2
Theme Park,Do not come here on a weekend.  Long lines with slow service and half occupancy in some cases.  The rides are boring and not worth an hour each.  Also bring lots of sunscreen.  Very little shade while you wait,2
Theme Park,Hot. Crowded. No social distancing or masking. Very little shade to hide from the hot sun. Piped in music is irritating and waits for the rides are long. Did not enjoy it much.,2
Theme Park,"(Translated by Google) They lie, it's not how it appears in the photos

(Original)
Mienten no es como aprece en la fotos",2
Theme Park,Fun for the kids but not all attraction was open. Not too many games open for kids to play. Bought one of those free refill drinks. All the good sodas was empty there was no Coke Sprite only orange soda or  water available on all of the machines there was over there. Food overpriced.,2
Theme Park,For the price you would think the park would be larger.  You can walk the whole park in about 2 hours or less.  Not worth the 90 dollar price tag.  And I've been to the one in Orlando it was much better than the New York one,2
Theme Park,"The park is small compared to Legoland Florida.  This is a park for toddler from the few rides some were on ""timeout"" as they said.  The food at least was good. The apple fries horrible!!  Short on staff , long lines. Not worth the money  for that small park.",2
Theme Park,"It was okay , but the lines were an hour long for all the rides. Half the rides were closed due to staffing , more for 2 to 8 year Olds. The 9 year Olds needed bigger rides.",2
Theme Park,Had so much potential but fell short. Half the rides closed the 1st day then more rides closed the 2nd day,2
Theme Park,"Caring and Loving Staff
The staff was fantastic and the park was clean and neat. My son has Autism and they gave him a Hero pass that help him get through to enjoying himself.",2
Theme Park,"Disappointing
They shut half the rides due to no staff, a lot of money for what it is, it was an ‘ok’ day out. Won’t be returning.",2
Attraction,Legoland has gone woke!!!!!No more Sleeping Beauty on the Storybook ride......Gay Pride Parade in the Legoland VillagesNot a fan.....,2
Attraction,I can sum this trip up by telling you that we paid extra to get in an hour early for quick access to the rides and none of them were open. Literally none of them.,2
Theme Park,"AVOID. Not nearly prepared to let in public as too much of park is closed. Uninspiring rides, long lines, and too much cheesy can't win typical carnival fair type games. Maybe they'll have their act together by August but for now save your money. Will say staff is friendly.",2
Airport,TSA needs help.  Two lines too long,2
Theme Park,"Good thing i pre checked my campsite before staying there.  Completely a ripoff.  Tent sites completely suck. Not level an super tiny.  Most of them your stuck sleeping on a hill.  An the price just to get in is outrageous.   If you want to view a super huge rock, perfect place for you",2
Airport,Was told that baggage was at carousel 4.Then ended at carousel 3.. Could not find Suttle bus for car rental.,2
Airport,One place to get coffee in the international terminal. Slow service. Few choices,2
Museum,Hannahs mirror maze.  4 year old made it through in 10 minutes.  50 bucks for 4 of us gone that quick.,2
Airport,Finding a parking spot at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was like winning the Squid Games!!!! Apparently EVERYONE is going somewhere!!! 🤓,2
Theme Park,"Beautiful decorations,terrible choice of food. Pay full price for a ticket for a half-opened park. Very dissatisfied. Long waits at the couple restaurants open. I have long awaited a trip to Dollywood and feel completely underwhelmed. Love Dolly but Dollywood is a flop.",2
Theme Park,"Some rides are closed, a lot of people driving school is malfunctioning al the time, so out of 4 hours, real rides will make  5-10 minutes total. Mostly its just walking",2
Theme Park,I was disappointed.  I have been coming for over 15 years. This is the first time I have seen it dirty.  Every time I went into a  bathroom it was dirty. Tables were not cleaned off. I was just so confused. This has never happened.,2
AZM,"Used to be fun when they did cool events for holidays and more. Now that it's under new ownership, it's just ok.",2
AZM,Not enough parking space near the entrance Iam handicapped and had to park away from entrance. I am not sure that they have Valet parking but maybe they should.,2
AZM,Lot's of booths and attractions closed or being maintenance. We visited during the work week. Maybe that was the reason but for the admission price I was a bit disappointed. Alan and Judy,2
AZM,That I think this place doesn't have enough space for their  animals.,2
AZM,"The first place we went to was Africa exhibit the animals seemed super depressed. The Florida exhibit was definitely better and I didn't get a chance to look at the Asia exhibit. It could have been worse, but I feel like it wasn't worth the $40 ticket.",2
AZM,"Entry to pricey for families and what $4.50 for soda each not for me , was ok but spoiled by Milwaukee County Zoo .",2
AZM,Worst $5 french fries ever had in my life from Joe's Diner,2
AZM,There were not enough animals to see...maybe they were put up for weather reasons? Kinda disappointed tho...especially for $40.,2
AZM,The exhibits are dated. The animals are not very visible at times and the parking area was a disaster area littered with baby diapers and trash of all sorts.,2
AZM,"A lot of attractions have shut early at 3 PM. I personally felt the way a lot of the animals are being kept is not species-appropriate, especially in terms of space.",2
AZM,"The attractions were fat and unmaintained, it should illegal. They were depressing to look at. Luckly the animals were a nice distraction",2
AZM,Not enough animals. I'm from Pittsburgh and the OUR zoo has many animals,2
AZM,Truly not worth the price they charge for admission.  This zoo charges almost 2x more than many of the more well known zoos.  Really not much to see.,2
AZM,Hardly none of the vendors are open. The ppl where u feed the parakeet were very rude.,2
AZM,"So excited to go where social distancing and masks were touted!  Bah!!!  50/50 compliance at best and staff seemed to care less.  Mistake of an outting for our family..  Sorry, but def would not recommend in these times, most definately misleading advertising .  Disappointing...",2
AZM,"Very depressing visit. The animals were in very small habitats. No grass, all dirt in habitats. All the animals looked bored and depressed. A real downer. I will not be back. They did a good job of socially distancing, all staff wore masks and most patrons wore masks as well.",2
AZM,"Very few animals. Half are hiding, so that makes it difficult. Safari tour is NOT worth standing in line. Ticket prices are ridiculous, as are food prices!!!",2
AZM,"The zoo is ok, just eat before you go unless you like paying 6.00 for a cold hotdog in a cold bun, 6.00 for a soda or ridiculous amounts for beers, drinks pretty much everything costs a lot, so be prepared.",2
AZM,"Very nice zoo, but the Africa exhibit was a little disappointed because there were not too many animals. Also there were a lot of people without masks. I understand that some people don’t care, but as a healthcare worker, this is unacceptable.",2
AZM,It's a VERY small zoo. Especially when compared to the Bronx zoo. Not much to see here,2
AZM,Not a well stocked place not many animals out during our visit staff was nice,2
AZM,Seems like it needs an update? Snake and fish room looks like it's from the 70s. SMells bad,2
AZM,Not enough social distancing or mask compliance. Lots of areas with tons of crowds.,2
AZM,"No temperature checks,social distancing was NON EXISTENT and facemask wearing was probably around 60%.",2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) A little expensive, for the size.

(Original)
Un poco caro, para el tamaño.",2
AZM,"A small zoo, very few varieties of animals. Didn’t love the living conditions and environment set for a few animals. Like tiger was living in a small place, with not much room to have a proper walk or a stretch. Not sure if it was given that cage temporarily but really felt sorry for him.",2
AZM,They just need to limit how much people go in in one day at a time way too crowded,2
AZM,Not everything open. Were hungry + had to leave to get food. Not much there.,2
AZM,"This Zoo used to be amazing. Now, more than half the exhibits and rides are closed, and they still want to charge almost $50 a person? Very disappointing.",2
AZM,This Zoo would be great EXCEPT... I have been here 3 times now and each time a LOT of the exhibits and rides are closed 🤷. Not happy that I paid money for a membership and drive 1&1/2 hours just to walk around and look at closed signs.,2
AZM,Disappointed that mask aren't mandatory. So many people without them are all next to each other in groups. Yeah you have to wear them in line and on the train but still. Stupid,2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Few animals and very expensive groceries.

(Original)
Pocos animales y muy caro los comestibles.",2
AZM,"The animal exhibits need a lot of work. Very run down
Was not impressed for 43$ a person",2
AZM,Louisville Zoo is wayyyyy better. This zoo is small & when we visited there weren't many animals out. Didn't see any staff out talking to guests or working with animals...my kids were pretty disappointed so we left.,2
AZM,Too many attractions closed and still have to pay super high prices,2
AZM,Too hot and animals were hardly see as they were shading and its crowded,2
AZM,Not happy with lack of masks for as busy as it was no wonder covid won't go away,2
AZM,"We went this past Saturday and it was a complete disappointment.  We didn't see a lion, a tiger, a bear, the sloth was nowhere to be found. They only giraffe  was far away in a stable. No zebras either. It was really a big disappointment",2
AZM,It's too expensive and it doesn't have that much animal,2
AZM,"I really dreamed for long time go to that zoo,and finally went with my granddaughters...nothing I was expected. Just couple animals ,rides close parking lot dirty trash everywhere just one restaurant call cafe but not coffee....2 hours and gone ! Do not come back! 🥺🥺",2
AZM,Didn't see food or water in some of the animals areas. Didn't think their sanctuary was nice for the animals.  Also some of them had no other animal in with them.,2
AZM,I am a senior and it really does not to be senior friendly.  I am not able to walk long distances and there were very few places to sit down.,2
AZM,Too small and not alot of animals to see. 5 attractions closed,2
AZM,"Not as many animals anymore, no meerkat exhibit anymore, just not worth the 39bucks per person, about 9 years ago it was worth every penny, they had one tiger I believe.",2
AZM,2 stars bc of the water ride. Mostly birds at this zoo. Overly priced for adult admission. Be blessed,2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Very simple and they didn't have many animals on display

(Original)
Muy sencillo y no tenían muchos animales en exhibición",2
AZM,"One of your baby bears crying to be put back inside. It was way too hot out today. Didn’t even have the water fountain on for him. Poor thing. Hiding from the sun, hanging onto the gate.",2
AZM,The only complaint I have is the price of the handicapped scooter rentals. I live off a limited income and recently was in an accident and had to borrow money to afford one.,2
AZM,I found it a little crazy that on one ride they still had the social distancing  but in line everyone was as close to each other like before and on an other ride they were packed in like sardines. Who is making the rules ?,2
AZM,"Having seen the show, we expected a larger much nicer experience. At $42 a person we were done in less than an hour. Most exhibitions were closed.  All in all I’d say don’t waste your time or money until it’s done and fully opened again.",2
AZM,Severely disappointing. So many closed/limited attractions with no warning to prospective guests who pay full price for a partial experience.,2
AZM,"Way too overpriced for the experience you get, which wasn't much",2
AZM,Honestly it wasnt that good. A lots under construction and a lot of the animals weren’t out. its not that big,2
AZM,Looks to be a nice zoo but we paid for 4 about 160$ and it started raining 45 minutes in our visit and the animals was not out and we gave up after about 30 more minutes and no sorry about the weather no nothing good buy .,2
AZM,"Not big deal, the entrance ticket is too expensive for what it  really is.",2
AZM,Lots of exhibits closed. Food prices very high. $ 9 for dippin dots.,2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Few animals

(Original)
Poços animales",2
AZM,"Kinda pricey,  doesn't seem very organized,  lots of stuff closed",2
AZM,Not too great they didn't have a lot of animals and everything was way over the top expensive,2
AZM,We expected minimum and they are bare minimum. Price is not justified for the animals they have ( you can just count on fingers and most of them are 1 or 2 and most of them you cannot find). Do not recommend this zoo.,2
Theme Park,I don't feel that I can give a fair or accurate review since much of the park was not open due to people who would rather get stimulus money than an honest job. Staff was short. Not the park's fault. I would like to return when /if C19 is a memory and give Dolly's place a fair shake!,2
AZM,Aquarium is nice but it is very expensive. There is not many exhibits and you see the same one over and over.  We played and went slow and it only took 45 minutes.  It was a big disappointment.,2
Airport,There should be a more detailed instructions for people that are not from Georgia.,2
Theme Park,Not the best experience. Most of the restaurants and quick snack places were closed. Some of the main rides were also closed. If they do not offer the full experience then you shouldn't have to pay full price for half the fun.,2
AZM,Several animals not out. The carousel and face painting either wasn't open or closed an hour or so earlier than closing time and my kids were very disappointed about that.,2
Theme Park,Some really fun rides and great theme’ing! Unfortunately 80% of the restaurants and food courts were closed. I’m not sure where you are supposed to eat when nothing is open.,2
Theme Park,They should have refill stations throughout the park just for refills that would help lines. For those of us buying.too.. or if stayin in same have a side just for refills. Not happy could not get a drink without a long wait...,2
Theme Park,"Long lines.  I know they try their best.  Half the food places were closed.  Several rides were closed. All the closures just added to the wait times for everything else.  All we did was stand in line.  The workers were friendly and nice.   The park is clean.  Still, all we did was stand in line.",2
AZM,Took a trip as we had never been to the zoo before. It was okay. It was kind of sad seeing how little space some animals had. Very busy and lots of people taking their time to view the animals. I dont plan on going back,2
Theme Park,Not very many options for food and drinks and the ones they did have had longer lines than the rides!,2
Theme Park,Most of the food spots I wanted to try was not open.,2
Theme Park,"Place was a little run down. Employees didn't put any effort in their jobs. To get a drink the lines were extremely long, wait would be 30 minutes or longer. It was much quicker to use vending machines.",2
Theme Park,It’s a great place but they took out the souvenir penny machine and it greatly disappointed me. I’ve got one every time I’ve came to Dollywood. Please bring it back.,2
Airport,"Congrats to the geniuses at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport where in Terminal E you can purchase travel necessities at the Mont Blanc, Pandora and Spanx stores but not find a cup of coffee anywhere!",2
Theme Park,Nice park. Still really new. Extremely painful to watch one person do everything for the ride. Ride is 30 seconds and it takes 10 minutes to load and unload people. Apps line times were 10 minutes but actually took over 45 minutes. Maybe one day they will work out the kinks.,2
Airport,It was nice until I lost my wallet,2
Theme Park,A lot of closed food stablishments. They say on the weekends they are open. Not worth it on week days then,2
Attraction,Lots of disorganization. Nicest people work there but why one person on the front desk during check in and check out times. Things like that throughout the park.,2
Museum,"We came here a few years ago and the kids really enjoyed themselves. We went back today and were extremely disappointed. At least a quarter of the exhibits or games either weren’t working at all or weren’t working correctly. For the price, it definitely wasn’t worth it and we won’t be back.",2
Garden,Cannot believe how things have changed! Discovery Center and Butterfly Center are still good but the Conservatory and it's gardens are gone. Roads are in disrepair. Not going back.,2
Airport,So apparently Sacramento International Airport and Southwest Airlines don’t enforce mask mandate in the gate areas.,2
Airport,"If you arrive early to pick up somebody flying in, the cell phone lot is a good place to wait.. It is free... Unfortunately, there is no running water or snacks for sell.. If you need to use the restroom you have to use the porta potties.. That's all the cell phone lot has to offer..   Visit the A.M. P.M., grab a snack than head to the cell phone lot..",2
Theme Park,"Second time visiting Dollywood, can't say I'm very impressed, the entire park smells terribly and I was disappointed that the park doesn't wrap around to the front from the back. All of that walking can be very daunting, especially to someone with disabilities.",2
Theme Park,workers were very rude and only one restaurant was open with a 6 hour wait. but rides were perfect😁,2
AZM,There's so many other things going on that it's hard to find the animals. It's supposed to be a zoo but there's not a lot of animals to see without doing a lot of walking and searching. It's set up very chaotic.,2
AZM,"The Asian animal exhibit was closed .
Half the animals are not even seen .
The whole zoo just has a hand full of animals.
Disappointed !!!!",2
Theme Park,For the money that you spent they should have more rides for the kids.. Alot of walking no shade spot to hangout to cool down..,2
Theme Park,My only complaint would be other groups ruining it.,2
Theme Park,It was a rainy day and I think if most of the big rides are shutdown then people should get a discount for the day I spent $75 just to walk around and buy food and look at things.... even most of the shows were not going on at this time and why I don't know cuz they would have been inside,2
Theme Park,"So disappointed. 2/3 of their food places were closed as well as several shops. I will say that the Entertainment Manager and Food Manager took excellent care of us. But, we paid full price and got less that even 3/4 value.",2
Airport,"Busy, decent time, lots of delayed flights thou. No food no nothing",2
Airport,Tsa super busy with few agents..I almost missed my plane,2
Theme Park,"At this time there is very rides open, not many places to eat, and they slacked on the pumpkin decor. A lot of the little shops were closed. If all we are getting is half of the park then we should only be paying half of the price. We were so disappointed and do not recommend at this time.",2
Museum,"Not as exciting as it use to be, was in and out in 30 minutes.
Disappointed didn't have Batman or Catwoman anymore.",2
AZM,Sad didn’t see no polar bears?? And they took out the 4 d theater that my children loved!!! And unfortunately way more beer drinking I would rather that not be !,2
Theme Park,The only good thing this trip to silver dollar city was the breakfast at the mill. The lines was so long it was miserable took over 30 minutes in line for a drink forget rides. first time we left before dark. It's stupid busy.,2
Theme Park,"Definitely not what it used to be. Just like everywhere else, they've been hit by the staff shortage.
A lot of the old dippin dots carts are empty, some of the shops are closed off, just doesn't feel as alive as it used to.

5/5 legacy
4/5 expectations
2/5 reality",2
Theme Park,Prices have gone up and so has the wait lines. Only thing that had gone down is the amount of food options available. Have the vending machines are broken forcing you to wait in thirty minute lines to refill a cup with a free refill.,2
Airport,"Bathrooms use scented hand soap. Really dislike the smell. Most restaurants/shops closed early. Extremely limited food options, bring food with you.",2
Theme Park,"Continue to charge premium prices yet deliver well below even mediocre services. Many kiosks closed, rides shut down randomly, etc.

Even for additional paid items, like refill cups at $70, receive NO ADDED BENEFITS.",2
Theme Park,Love the park but I received terrible service at the front entrance. The woman collecting tickets acted unprofessionally and spoke to us very rudely as we tried to pull up our tickets.,2
Airport,"Waited 30 minutes at my arrival gate for wheelchair assistance to my connecting flight.  These types of services shouldn't be offered if not staffed appropriately.  The young lady that finally got me to my connecting gate was very polite and helpful,  but it should have never taken that long for service.   Will avoid ATL layover in the future at all costs.",2
AZM,"The only complaints I have is that the layout is a little chaotic, not enough signage and it's a little pricey",2
Museum,"NOT THAT INTERESTING!!
Would NOT chose to spend money or effort to visit this institution again! It cost 2 X as much in transportation as admittance!",2
Airport,Make sure you get plenty of time for security. I think I've been spoiled by BWI airport where even with the longest lines they get you through security in 20 minutes so the hour wait to get through the security kind of made me frustrated not to mention people like to skip line,2
Airport,"Hard to believe that at 8:30pm every restaurant was closed in the terminal that handled Delta and Southwest. Any of the retail stores that carry food were out and they were all closed by 9pm.  Alot of hungry, irritated people in that terminal.",2
AZM,"Very slow, the ticket counter has only one table, the long queue is a train.",2
Theme Park,"A large number of booths, shows, & eateries were closed which is not good considering October is one of busiest months of the year. Also not many gospel groups this year which is why we visit in October.",2
Theme Park,Most venues closed. Not worth the entrance fee today could not even go to riverboat. Lots of blocked roads for no entry.,2
Theme Park,"Much more fun to go on some of the little things around town, the lines were very long and I was there for 5 hours and went on 2 rides",2
Airport,Beware if you have TSA Pre-check it closes at 9 p.m. and you have to go through the regular checkpoint. That would have been good information to know especially when you are scheduled for the last flight of the night. Also the traffic to get from the North and South terminals is unorganized so if you miss your exit its gonna take about 5-10 mins to get back to your terminal.,2
Museum,Only for kids. Not suitable for Adults. Few exhibitions only. $32 entrance fee is not worthy for this place. Over priced.,2
Museum,"This is just about the food. It’s old, damp, and wilted. I had to pick a bunch of soft croutons and brown lettuce out before eating 🤢",2
Airport,Almost missed flight because kiosk gave us wrong gate. Womp womp.,2
Theme Park,Dollywood is really in need of employees..Half or the restaurants are closed..We had to be on a waiting list for 2 hours to get hamburgers and fries that were terribly expensive..Rides lines were an hour to an hour and a half to ride.,2
Theme Park,Disappointed in Dollywood 's new pass structure.  Don't need Waterparks!  Why punish Gold Passholders bu reducing our discount from 20 to 15.,2
Airport,Baggage claim needs to be more organized.,2
Airport,Not enough places to eat late. Got in at 930 p.m. and almost everything was closed,2
Theme Park,"Kinda disappointed most food places were closed some rides closed. Only things I really enjoyed was the bakery, music and two rides",2
Airport,Staff could be a little more friendly,2
Theme Park,Last night at Dollywood having dinner. They are making us wait…..the anticipation 😩,2
AZM,"Was disappointed in the size of the aquarium for the price. Was expecting it to be a whole lot bigger since there are 2 buildings, but apparently they don't have anything in the bigger building, which is very deceiving when purchasing tickets. Not worth the money.",2
AZM,"Not much changes, more exhibits closed each time we visit.",2
Airport,"Invasive customs experience with emptying bags and somewhat uncomfortable questions. Wouldn’t recommend for arrival from international flights, and others in the US give better experiences (at least in my experience - ie. Houston). Beyond that, it has decent infrastructure.",2
Airport,"Don't recommend traveling too soon after surgery or vaccinations, both of which I did in error",2
Airport,Need more businesses that accept cash!,2
Zoo,"Just wanted to take the 5-mile drive, but it's closed for refurbishing.",2
Airport,Not much direction as to where to go for the different flights,2
Airport,No food concessions are open for late travelers!!,2
Museum,Very expensive for the small museum and  most of the figures don't look much like their real life counterpart.,2
Theme Park,"Ridiculously busy for what it is. Six Flags/Disney type lines for 2-3mins of wooden coaster quality. 2-3hr wait for most rides unless you buy their version of a “fast pass”. I do not recommend, although the staff are very nice",2
Theme Park,Disappointed. Annual passholders. Went to see Fall displays and lights in park in the evening. By 8pm things were shutting down. It was very dark to walk the pathways and many amazing displays not lit up as we expected.,2
Theme Park,Lines were too long. Over an hour wait on nearly every ride. Many food locations were not in service and those that were had wait times worse than the rides. The only thing I liked was the tram ride from the parking lot to the entrance and back,2
Aquarium,dolphin show started at 7. we got there literally 7:01. the lady said sorry you can’t go in it started at 7…,2
Airport,Sadly the restaurants close so early! This is the second time I've missed out on Chic Fila by a few seconds.,2
Theme Park,"Typical of any other ""amusement park"" long lines and extremely expensive food.
I can check it off the list but I don't foresee a return visit.",2
Theme Park,Get rid of paper straws!!!   Quit raising prices and taking away discounts!!  God knows thisplacehas made enough in 60 years!!,2
Attraction,I would not recommend Legoland to anyone with children older than 12.  There’s not enough rides to keep them entertained.,2
Attraction,For kids 10 years and younger IMO. I was not impressed with their customer service.,2
Garden,"Lodge needs updating.  So disappointed in rooms and inside appearance.  Carpets in hallway are filthy.  Room carpet stained and dirty.  Was really surprised at how this lodge has deteriorated .beds are uncomfortable and furniture needs replaced.  Not as advertised!!Grounds are beautiful,",2
Airport,The only problems of this Airport is that it is a giant maze! And it can be really asinine when it comes to flights on time.,2
AZM,"Nice aquarium, however,  it's expensive and takes 36 minutes to walk through. Not worth the price unfortunately.",2
Attraction,"Everything is very over priced, and half the rides are closed during the week and off season, they should lower the prices on those days. They also over charged me and never gave me my refund 🤨. Overall Neat place to visit once but probably not again.",2
Theme Park,It closes too early we didn't have a chance to see it all or enjoy any shows.,2
AZM,"The price is small and expensive, the indoor space is narrow, and the service is not very good.",2
Theme Park,Got discount tickets to get in after 5 but no shows and a lot of shops were closed. Pumpkin patch was nice but not worth the price to get in even with the discount. My 1st and last time there.,2
Attraction,I was disappointed by Legoland California. It was lackluster. Issues with reserve and ride (refunded). Not like Disneyland so don't compare. Though during a pandemic overall the park did ok. Recommend ages 5 to 11/12.,2
AZM,For kids I'm sure it's great but for young adults it's boring and not worth the price.,2
Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport how do you not have the Atlanta Braves on any TV??? #ChopOn #GoBraves,2
Airport,"People forgot about COVID, there was like 8 million people on the train",2
AZM,It was cool to see but not worth the price. Drive an extra 45 minutes to the Bass Pro Aquarium. The Branson aquarium took us 30 minutes to walk through and the Bass Pro took 2 hours for the same price!,2
Theme Park,"(Translated by Google) scarcity of money

(Original)
돈 아까움",2
Museum,Came here in 2014 and had a really great time. Went back last night and was not impressed and felt like it was to short of an attraction to cost my family of 5 $150.,2
Airport,"Slowest TSA security check ever experienced. More than an hour standing in line, waiting.",2
Theme Park,Many rides and shops closed. Weather didn't help so I'm guessing that was some of that.,2
Aquarium,I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the money. Where the kids go because they have nowhere to look..,2
Theme Park,Not what was expected nothing like website kids can't touch most Legos more for kids 5- others will be miserable and quiet expensive... over,2
Theme Park,Brick-or-treat was not worth the money at all.  They make it out to be this huge deal and it was awful. No characters out until 3pm and there was no schedule of where/when they would be out. A staff member Delia was quite rude and accused member of party being dismissive. The price is not worth it.,2
Airport,Busy busy busy... Crowed at all times.,2
Airport,TSA should act like they are thankful to have jobs instead of being snippy and nasty to people.,2
AZM,"Hahahahhah I’ll never forget the day my RSP drill instructor Ramirez asked if we liked animals and liked looking at them at a zoo and If whether or not we felt retarded at the zoo. Lmfaooooooo. “Wow, look at that monkey, I’m so retarded” 😂 let’s look at a bunch of animals !",2
Theme Park,It's OK if you have a one to 5 year children if any all are not very boring,2
AZM,Disappointed with all the construction. Also the limited food selection and so many rides shut down,2
Airport,"In general, I almost never have issues with the Atlanta airport.",2
AZM,Not the best. The London one is much better. Go there if you have the time.,2
Theme Park,"Since the main drive was closed to see the relief (with no warning from the park or hotel) it was an unrequited trip. The park itself is lovely with camping,golf, cycling and walking trails.",2
Airport,"Due to Covid mitigations and contruction of the airport there are things that need to be improved. For one, the USO needs to be open for military personnel. It's quite a shame that military personel has to sleep on the floor cause there is no where for them to go when having long layovers.",2
Airport,A quiet evening here before it closed. All day today was just thinking about wanting to head to Sacramento International Airport for the flight to San Antonio International Airport,2
Airport,Eat before you go. No where was open and the places that were had lines like crazy. Then it took forever to get the food once you ordered.,2
Museum,"They definitely need a new Elvis made, looked nothing like him. Butchered him!! 🤨 Did like that they put props in to take pictures.",2
Aquarium,There is nothing to see because you have to pay for parking.,2
Airport,Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Why in the world yall move #TSAPRECHECK to Decatur?!?! (New south checkpoint) Also those fancy machines that’s supposed to be like MRIs suck! Shouldn’t take anymore than 15 mins to walk through Precheck.. meanwhile people lining up waiting for their stuff for 20 plus mins! SMH 🤦🏾‍♀️,2
Airport,"Crowded like always  many many flights, many stored",2
Museum,Favorite place is the movie theaters cuss that’s the best place to fall asleep cuss there nothing to do,2
Airport,Why would an airport have every restaurant in an entire concourse closed at 5:45 on a Saturday?,2
Aquarium,"I'm not impressed, it's looks like a mall with a big shark tank",2
Airport,"Got off our plane at 6:45 to quickly find out nearly all restaurants closing. The concourse was packed and people looking to eat before next flight. Assume it's a lack willing people to work. So, crackers and snacks were dinner on the layover. Travelers thru Harrfield beware!",2
Airport,The rental car shuttle doesn't come frequently enough. I have flown into this airport about 6 times and everytime it takes 30min for the shuttle. Please add more.,2
Theme Park,Management company has lost interest. Too much controversy around the park theme. Needs an update,2
Attraction,"Place is awesome! But literally 80% of the attractions/rides are closed. Food stands are closed. Charging stations don't work. Again it's a cool place but if you're looking to actually enjoy the rides, now is not the time apparently.",2
Theme Park,"The park was closed, the only thing open was the mountain but it was okay. But not worth$35 dollar's",2
Attraction,So overrated. No shows. The rides were good for 2-3 years old. My daughter loves Lego friends but there were no section for them. Bad food. A lot of rides were closed. Not worth the money you spent.,2
AZM,"Um yeah that's what I thought

#kentuckykancelled #flowers #wood #rollercoaster #thunderrun #rollercoasters #rolliecoastie #kentucky #louisville #kentuckykingdom #dinn #umyeahthatswhatithought  #nomariokartbeforemarriage",2
Theme Park,"Want a lot of money for the few hours they are open, and their food is expensive but made with cheap ingredients. It use to be great.",2
Airport,International Transfers are a breeze..Just a long walk.,2
Attraction,"Legos are getting faded and need some TLC.
Some rides on weekdays are closed.",2
Airport,"It may be the ""busiest"" Airport, but it's actually the worst. I've been to different Airports in the US and, honestly, this place can do better. Stop allowing dangerous homeless people in the Airport. Please Improve.",2
Airport,Too far from terminals and quite inconvenient. Could do better,2
AZM,"Adults are having a hard time standing up, so I really want more chairs.",2
Theme Park,"Was on friday, crowded lines for everything, kingdom heirs show great,not much for older adults to do that dont ride rides, we miss craftsman alley with real craftsman making stuff,",2
Garden,"Gardens were just okay. Staff was incredibly rude and ruined our entire experience. Not just one member either, we had three different encounters with horribly rude staff members.",2
Airport,Please keep these restaurants open!! Your flight crews are hungry and it’s so hard  for us as we have such limited time between flights.,2
AZM,"Children and adults are 2400 yen more expensive !!! Moreover, the stamp card is 500 yen (･ o ･;) It&#39;s too small to enjoy !!! Kindergarten children were still happy (laughs) I think it&#39;s useless when it comes to elementary school. I came back in a Ferris wheel with a high price.",2
Theme Park,lines too long and never could ride anything.  Powder keg broke down and waited hour in line to not even ride it.,2
Airport,"Cant seem to get enough buses out to pick up individuals going to parking lots. Now a 3rd bus  has gone by for “Rental Cars,” and we’re stuck out here in the cold waiting for a bus.  All 18 of us!",2
Airport,A great airport (once you are inside). Getting to the airport is an Atlanta disgrace. The mayor should be ASHAMED of the mess.,2
Airport,"Apparently there is some construction going on so if you aren't certain where you're going be sure to ask; they haven't modified their signage to reflect the construction so it's very easy to end up in the wrong place. It was very hot in there, the bathrooms were dirty and there was only one soap dispenser in the women's restroom that wasn't empty.",2
Airport,"Many outlets are so worn out your phone won't charge and keeps slipping down.

Dated and dirty.

At least 1/3 of the people are unmasked or wear their mask under their nose.

Run around getting through customs and on to connecting flights. Confusing signage. Employees countermanding instructions.",2
Theme Park,Nothing was open but the rides I'm a summing they are really short staff for the reason why things were shut down but yet you're still paying full price,2
Aquarium,You know what's cooler than getting into the water with the largest collection of sharks in the Northeast at Adventure Aquarium? Literally nothing.,2
Airport,2/3 of restaurants are closed in the international departure lounge.,2
Airport,Delta took 30 minutes to get bags off a plane. Unacceptable,2
Theme Park,"Sounds like Dollywood has gotten a lot more strict since I was there last.

Shame on them for denying people the tools to defend themselves.

Looks like it's beach trips from now on for me and mine 🌞⛱

Dolly Parton",2
Theme Park,"When mama says Dollywood opens at 9, but they actually don’t open until 11 😣 Oops!",2
Aquarium,I would be able to give 5 stars if not for the poor beluga whales. I will not return. There are better places with just sharks and more window.  I will not return I felt bad about going.  Some animals must not be contained.,2
Airport,Needs better instructional signage.,2
Museum,"A poor example of a museum
I went to the museum today for the first time in a long time. I just want to say that it was  really not that interesting at all. I swear it is the same as when I went to this museum when I was a kid. If you go, you can get through it in an hour easily.",2
Airport,"Some of the food places still closed, with longer lines at the open ones.",2
Airport,"For the number of flights that go through that airport, they don't have adequate seating to wait by your gate. Also, if you arrive before 9am or after 9:30pm, don't expect any food options but the convenience store.",2
Museum,Expensive and then many things are not free after you get in. You have to pay extra to do them.,2
Airport,"Security included a man barking orders... A dog inspecting the passengers, careful xray and even article swabbing. We got the VIP treatment, I guess.",2
Airport,"Letting everyone know we are okay. An active shooter Open fire in Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport while we were at the airport. 

We got out and safe outside.",2
Airport,"check on y’all people .

active shooter in Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport",2
Aquarium,I absolutely love aquariums. And when i lived in Atlanta I had an annual pass. Their new shark exhibit looked boring. Especially the tank. They did not have the friendliest staff either. Especially those in the end of the store when you leave.,2
Theme Park,Some of the attractions were closed yet paid full price.,2
Theme Park,Most of the food locations were closed and there seemed to be a lot of shut downs with the rides.,2
Garden,"Fantasi in lights not worth the $30 p/p
Everything closes at 9 so before you head to the lights I recommend you do everything else fist..",2
Theme Park,The lines for the food is longer than for the rides. All of the food locations took 30-60 no matter the time of day,2
Theme Park,I love Dollywood but the parking price is ridiculous? It’s been $20 all year without the gold pass. We came in this evening and it’s now $25 🤷‍♂️ They were so full they were parking over in splash country parking. I think their getting way to greedy on parking prices.,2
Theme Park,On their website it says limited capacity but what I saw today was not limited capacity! We couldn’t even move around the park so many people and we couldn’t ride any rides because lines were two hours! Ridiculous,2
Museum,Looks cool from the road but that's about it...wouldn't go or recommend this to anyone.,2
Airport,Had an international flight and I got no heads up about the mountain of paperwork to do prior to my flight. My flight was also changed to a different gate and I had to find it out for myself causing me to almost miss my flight. It's big with plenty to do but just don't expect the service here to be friendly or helpful.,2
Aquarium,The most poorly designed restrooms of any public attraction I have ever seen. I've seen high school gyms built in the 1970s with better facilities. It's a major tarnish on an otherwise great attraction.,2
Museum,"The museum and attractions in the building next door were great. However, customer service was poor. The gentleman who helped us didn't seem like he wanted to be there and was a bit snarky. Didn't catch his name on his name tag but his favorite movie printed on his tag was ""The Jerk"".",2
Aquarium,"Packed with people, food and drinks are extremely expensive",2
Theme Park,I'm sorry Dolly but $80+ to enter your park plus addt'l $25 for parking is just outrageous.  We came during the Christmas lights which was great but we would probably never return.,2
Airport,Busy andy bumper to bumper trafic,2
Museum,"Wasnt able to get into the train because it was all booked by the time we arrived. The space center itself is very small, so there is really not much to do if you dont take the train tour. The products at the gift shop were very low quality.  Was a little disappointed :(",2
Garden,Went for the Pumpkin at Calloway's event. It's massively overpriced. Might be halfway decent for children but even then it's really expensive for something you can walk through in under 15 minutes.,2
Theme Park,"This is so crazy today.  I have been here so many times...
..even in season and have never encountered this many people.......very uncomfortable.",2
Airport,I think its time for management to do something about traffic control its a nightmare!!!,2
Theme Park,"Was very disoriented, many rides were under maintenance 🙄",2
Museum,It was a bit underwhelming to be honest. I was expecting more for the price.,2
Attraction,There is no point to buying the tickets or pass online. You have to rebuy a physical copy when you arrive. It's pretty stupid. Might as well save yourself the time and get ready to wait in the membership services line.,2
Theme Park,I have loved it in the past but they did not have enough workers.  To many of their areas were closed,2
AZM,The facilities are not very friendly to the disabled,2
Aquarium,General Admission $36.95 ????? Are you guys out of your minds???? Not even if they give you a real dolphin for free it would be worth that much !,2
Theme Park,"Terribly crowded when went. No friendly workers. The line lines were atrocious. Little capacity on rides and slow operations. Go for the environment not the rides. Food is mediocre and terribly overpriced. Park tickets overpriced. In my opinion not worth it, if going for the rides.",2
Aquarium,"Overrated and did not meet out expectations
It is packed with people. Many decorations but very limited fish. Unable to see shows despite buying tickets in advance. If you come at 10 am you can only see show at 3pm",2
Museum,Some of the attractions closed. Also really packed.,2
Museum,There were some very long lines throughout the place. They need some water bottle vending machines throughout too.,2
Aquarium,The aquarium was a good experience but the cafeteria food was not good and was served cold after paying double the price of the food.,2
Museum,Overpriced and over rated go for a ride in cafes cove instead...,2
Theme Park,"All of handicap parking was taken in all 3 lots, had to park a long distance away from Entrance and walk back.Lot of uphill walking",2
Museum,Expensive for a 30 min visit. Alot of the displays didn't look like the actor/actress.,2
Theme Park,Workers need to move faster getting people  on and off the rides,2
AZM,I was not impressed at all. The funnel cakes were fried too long. The prices for food too high. The lights was not as good as they use to be.,2
Museum,"Not terrible but disappointing to say the least. I was hoping for more memorable exhibits, but most everything you see will be randomly placed items with hard-to-find labels.",2
Airport,The personal check is a catastrophe. I don't know any other airport where it takes so long. today again 1h and 30min.,2
Theme Park,I hate to give a bad review but there were waaaay too many ppl. The whole thing abt limited ppl due to covid was a joke. Even getting a drink was a 30 minute wait. I've been going to dollywood since the 90s and it's changed so much. For the worst. I probably won't go back. It makes me sad.,2
Airport,Mad rush to the airport that couldn't go any smoother,2
Theme Park,I went with my boyfriend to celebrate my birthday in October. A lot of attractions were closed and it was difficult to find food. It would be better for young children considering there was not much to do but very expensive prices.,2
Airport,Only two immigration agents for almost 400 international passengers,2
Airport,Disabled. No wheelchair attendants. Then an attendant rudely took my wheelchair. Flight was delayed. Second time in a week. All food places closed.,2
Museum,About 1/4 of the attractions were broken or shut down....  I loved the place when I was younger but you could tell it’s falling apart with no plan to maintain it.,2
Airport,Can't tell you yet I'm still here and they've closed down almost every single restaurant in concourse C. Thank goodness for LeeAnn Chin.,2
Garden,Would have given it a 5 but the hotel lodge had dirty carpet in the room and was way over priced,2
Aquarium,Not plenty of animals but plenty of screens. Not worth the price entry + parking fee.,2
Garden,Worst organized Christmas light drive through I’ve ever been to. What’s the point of buying a ticket for a specific time slot if you then have to wait an hour plus AFTER the time slot you purchased? Lights were cool though.,2
AZM,Food was slightly dry and alot of the zoo for me felt diaappointing hope to change this in the future,2
Theme Park,MAKE A RESERVATION OR YOU WILL BE TURNED AWAY!!! there needs to be a system setup so that people don't drive hours just to be turned away.,2
Theme Park,I would give less if I didn't get a discount getting in because of how expensive it is.,2
Theme Park,The view was spectacular but the lines and waiting period were too long. No Covid guide lines were observed at that attraction. The sky lifts were always crowded with no room to move at all. It creates an unhealthy environment for visitors.,2
Airport,So so. Needs more signage for car rental area. Everyone says baggage claim the walk ? Not clear at all.,2
Zoo,"Schedule is weird, and we traveled all the way to find out it was closed early 🙄",2
AZM,I think the zoo should spend more time on their animal exhibits than they do attractions and rides.,2
Theme Park,"Even though they used reservations, the park had way too many. Lots of restaurants and small carts were either closed or none around. To get a drink, refill  took over 30 minutes standing in line.",2
Airport,"Rudest employees in the United States and Mexico are in Atlanta been to alot of airports and usually people are fairly nice, not the case in Atlanta",2
Airport,"It felt like we walked from Columbus Georgia to passport control!  The escalator wasn't working and then I added 40% of my daily steps, just to get to passport control.  They were not ready for us and I was an hour late getting home...",2
Airport,Officially at a 6 hour (yes y’all read that right) delay at  Sacramento International Airport. Someone @ JetBlue please explain why 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,2
Theme Park,"Rip off city starts with $25.00 parking  and escalates from there .  Take plenty of cash and a few credit cards.
You will need it.",2
Airport,"It's alright. For being a busy airport, I'm shocked that on a Sunday night everything was closed in terminal C. There were plenty of people still waiting on flights and nothing, I mean nothing, was open. I had to go to terminal B and spend 25 minutes in line to eat at one of 3 spots open in the vicinity. I get that paying for overtime or late night could be costly, but a girl was hungry!",2
Garden,Bougie overpriced Todd and Buffy kinda deal. Nice looking place. Not -$50 a head to look at Christmas lights on a weeknight- nice .,2
Airport,"I really appreciate San Diego when I am visiting Sacramento!! I don't know why, but things happen in Sacramento....and its always bad things! I only travel up North here when I absolutely positively have too!!",2
Aquarium,The place is nice and they have some outstanding exhibits that you won't find at most aquariums but it feels like mostly large exhibits and not as much of the smaller exhibits and diversity.  Totally worth your time.,2
Theme Park,Need more help and with prices that high should not have to wait so long.,2
Airport,"This is the armpit of all airports: the gates all have letters (A,B,C,etc) but departure screens use numbers, there are only seats available for 1/3 of people waiting to board, resrrooms were way overcrowded. TSA people were great and all employees were helpful, otherwise this was a terrible experience.",2
Theme Park,Dollywood is delaying opening today until 3pm! 12/10/2021,2
Theme Park,WAY TOO CROWDED!   I've been there a lot of times during Christmas. They do a great job at Christmas which is why I went again. However it was way too crowded which made it unenjoyable.,2
Theme Park,We bought 8 season passes but we are unable to use them because there are no availability on the reservation page. Still waiting on an answer from Dollywood to get a refund.,2
Theme Park,Christmas light were beautiful. Trying to leave the park is an awful experience and it would keep me from ever going again! We waited over an hour just to get on a tram and we had to fight to get on! It is the worst!,2
Airport,Border control for international arrival very poor 90 minute queue. No coffee type restaurants open only junk food available.,2
Theme Park,"They charged $20 bucks for parking 😒 and we stayed a couple hours to the Christmas activity,expensive parking!",2
AZM,We enjoyed seeing the animals there.  The reason for an2 star is because my sandwich was grab n go from Boomers cafe and was cold. I looked on the box and there was not a time written on the box. Who knows how long it was sitting there?,2
Aquarium,"They have a lot of fish, but the service is not very good.  The food is awful.  The pizza was unbaked, the hot dog was not hot, not even warm.",2
Airport,Terminal A.   Lots of food places closed.  What's open has long waiting lines with only 1 person working.,2
Theme Park,"Money extraction machine. Rides were hard to find, routes through all kinds of shops. Christmas lights were awesome though.",2
Aquarium,"Crowded, no social distancing event
The day I visited it was crowded and hardly anyone was wearing a face mask. There was no social distancing. There were little children coughing all over. This was not good especially with the emergence of the new COVID variant.",2
Theme Park,Never knew that Silver Dollar City SOLD OUT of daily entrance to tickets on-line.  Or that the park had a Capacity Limit. NOW... I know and will order in advance. Almost traveled from out of state for the weekend to take the Grandchildren  for Christmas and did it get to attend.,2
Airport,No workers to bring your suitcase.. It is almost midnight,2
Airport,The signage for cars is not nearly as good as other airports.,2
Museum,You need to bring back tram ride and include more lights. Was better pre CV.,2
Aquarium,"I have a child, so I think I&#39;ve been there two or three times, but there&#39;s nothing to see or do at any event than I thought.",2
Airport,Worst customs and security.  They had 1 person going through bags at security.  We had a 3 hour layover from Europe vacation and made it to our gate just in time to board.  Ridiculous and rude employees.,2
Zoo,San Diego zoo is far better. Even the Sacramento CA zoo is better.,2
Aquarium,"Need to try it on the weekday, weekends are very busy!!
Entry photo is $25 for 1 or 35 for multiple so make sure you're prepared 😉",2
AZM,Really disappointed in Wild Lights. Waited in line to park for over an hour only to be turned around because all of the lots were full. We didn't even end up going because of the complete chaos.,2
Theme Park,This trip i was upset due to the fact I payed $80 for time-saver and during to limited staff they was not checking at all rides and I wasted money,2
AZM,"I went once , I think Busch gardens are far more superior when it comes to animals",2
Attraction,Great place for family with young kids. Unless you want any customer service from the Guest Excellence Support Team. Then you are out of luck. “No exceptions can be made”.,2
Theme Park,For $84.00 it should have been all day access.  Over priced.,2
Theme Park,I hadn't been since I was in highschool. Now I remember why. The price for a Season Pass is more than SeaWorld with much less to do.,2
Theme Park,"So we have established that, you can’t use your season passes to Dollywood without a reservation. But, you sure can buy a one day ticket for that day. Absolutely pitiful man.",2
AZM,It is a little bit Pricey for such a small area.. But not that bad,2
Airport,"For an airport that has the number of people going through it on a daily basis,  it is very hot. There is no reason for that that airport to be so hot. Fix your a/c and use it.",2
Theme Park,"Way to crowded to enjoy visit. Has become a park where you just stand in lines and wait for rides, food and shows which I have not gotten into the last three visits.",2
Theme Park,As pretty as the lights are it was the worst experience I've had...way over capacity since rides were closed do to winter...was not worth what we paid.,2
Theme Park,I love the new events they do for holidays. But ticket how highly priced for the same rides I rode 15 years ago! Needs new rides. Also it would be nice if they put an inside jump gym and inflatable slides. Needs upgrade for sure.,2
Theme Park,Went the busiest weekend of the year!! Need more refreshment places to get a drink!!! Need heater stations to warm up!! Need more warm drink places We came 29 years ago and there were places to get warm drinks all over the place !!! Fireworks was great! Staff kind and friendly!,2
Theme Park,Season pass holders beware. You are limited on which days you can make reservations. If you want to pay full price for a 1 day ticket lots of time slots available but very limited availability for pass holders.,2
Airport,Confusion for wheelchair passengers making connections.,2
Theme Park,Would have gave more stars but it's about $80 a person and you have to pay a  Separate $20 to park. Also the ticket price above is only  for the amusement park it does not included the water park which is kind of disappointing. Also the food is ridiculously overpriced and it is horrible.,2
Airport,If you have a layover after 8pm bring your own food.  All the restaurants close at nine except for one or two so the lines are crazy stupid,2
Airport,"Hard to believe there was a worse place to catch a flight than LAX, but this one managed.  The wait was ridiculous - longer than my flight.  Lines backed up forever, not enough help.  Horrible.",2
AZM,"Christmas in the wild was not impressive at all. No activities for teens, just lights.",2
Theme Park,"It was very expensive. Religious tone. The one Roller coaster we were wble to get on was fun. Kids enjoyed the Christmas parade and tree. Again, way to expensive.",2
Attraction,"Used to be good but getting harassed about the Statewide Indoor mask Mandate is annoying and ruins the day.

Mostly did outdoor stuff only because it didn’t require masks.",2
Theme Park,"Nice place to see.
Lines were too long to enjoy riding the rides.
I find it was too pricy for what they had.
It's mainly alot of shops for a tourist trap to spend money.
Main thing I wanted to do there was tour the cave, but every time I went for the tour the line was full.",2
Zoo,"Two main buildings closed, one -- Birds -- for good. Tropical Discovery temporarily.",2
Theme Park,Way way way to packed not even the a little fun even for the kids you can't make your kid wait an hr in line just to ride something when they are only 4 cool place but not a place a my family is into. But to each there own,2
Attraction,We just visited the park today. I really don’t think it worth spending $90 for a one day ticket. Half of the rides were closed. The only good thing I would say about the park is it’s not so crowded as Disney or Universal Studio.,2
Museum,Went to the lights display and over half of the lights were not lit. Was offered no explanation or compensation. Paid full price for a light show and it didn't happen.,2
Airport,"Large and busy airport. Fairly easy to navigate and good signage if you aren't used to flying through. Only problem is flights seem to come and go 24 hours a day but the shops and restaurants absolutely aren't open. Early flight and all the restaurants in our terminal that supposedly open at 6 aren't. Going to be a long, hungry, 6 hour flight.",2
Museum,Not that great. Not worth the extra money for the exclusive exhibits tbh,2
Museum,Disappointed that the tram tour only included the rocket stop. Was wanting to do mission control.,2
Theme Park,"What do you do when Rock City, Ruby Ralls and Dollywood are all sold out for the next several days?? You take to the streets of your sweet town!",2
Airport,I can’t believe every restaurant in concourse C is closed.  I’ve never been to an airport and every damn restaurant is closed AT FREAKING 7pm!!!!!  WTH,2
Airport,"The airport itself is good, but the food options suck. 7:30pm on a Sunday and so many places are already closed. And for the places that are open, the lines are so very long. Another bad thing is, the businesses inside the airport never seem to update their hours on Google.  Guess the natives here in Atlanta are just lazy.",2
Theme Park,Lines for a drink or food are ridiculous.  No place should take 30 minutes or LONGER just for something to drink.,2
Aquarium,"Not really worth the $$$. Baltimore aquarium is better. I expected more, but you're price gouged on everything, and there's not as much as you'd expect.",2
Airport,If the tell you be there 2 hrs early plan on 3,2
Theme Park,"It is sad when you can't use your season passes, but they tell you that 1 day tickets are available.",2
Theme Park,We went 2 days before Christmas and half  of the attractions listed on the website for Christmas were not available.,2
AZM,Seems like every time i go a lot of the attractions are closed.,2
Theme Park,"Way too many people, had to wait over an hour for rides and food.  If you go, go on a Wednesday or Thursday",2
AZM,"Festival of lights was a huge disappointment wish I got movie tickets instead, wait until the late spring or summer when you can see the animals",2
Theme Park,"We when to see the Christmas show, but the last show was so poor not completely in all",2
Airport,Smaller airport. Lacks many amenities.,2
Airport,"If you have a night flight, better buy something to eat before 9pm, because afterwards you will not find anything to eat.",2
Attraction,We don’t like LEGOLAND as much as other parks. Waited in long lines for rides that weren’t very good. It was a good atmosphere but I can’t say I would ever go again.,2
Airport,Rudest and least helpful staff I've ever encountered at an airport.,2
Theme Park,"As long as you are buying one day passes you are good, they just love to screw over season pass holders. My family has had season passes for years but that is all coming to an end. I know Covid changed some things but they chose greed over their pass holders.",2
Aquarium,Website states they are limiting capacity and time slotting tickets. Must be a joke because we went today and it was so packed. I’ve been here many times before and I’ve never seen it this busy. We did not feel comfortable and quickly left.,2
Attraction,Half the dining options are closed today leading to intolerable wait times (> 1hr) at the  available ones. Could have been mitigated with vendor stations.,2
Museum,"Winter Wonderlights is a rip off. Paying $30+ for a walk around to see lights, might as well go to Tanglewoods Festival of Lights and save money. Regular admission(day time) is fun and always expanding",2
Museum,"I did not enjoy it. First of all, its over priced for the boring stuff that was there. It was overcrowded and super loud. They want you to pay to play arcade games. I highly doubt I would be back.",2
Theme Park,We spend like 1.30h for getting food (burger area ),2
Museum,Visit the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Much better.,2
AZM,"Zoo itself was nice, but 45 min wait in line to order food and another 45 min wait to receive food. Challenging with a two year old. Bring your own food if possible.",2
Airport,If I could fly around Atlanta I would avoid at all cost two stars because I didn't die but long lines rides staff,2
Theme Park,Christmas lights were beautiful but the maps and layout are very hard to follow. We spent hours just trying to find the kids section and still did not find all of the kids rides.,2
Attraction,Almost same price as Disneyland and my 10yo son was very disappointed,2
Museum,"A giant arcade,  crowded, many games were broken.  Fix your stuff, for $35 I expect more.",2
Attraction,2 hours just to get into the parking lot. Rides that are even working are 2 hours wait. My kid waited 1 1/2 hours only to be sent away for technical difficulties. No selection of food that isn't lines as long as the rides. This place blows.,2
Airport,Long lines for security at  Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport,2
Airport,This place is a mad house and no signs showing what to do really.,2
AZM,No signs for bathrooms.  But the lights were great. And there was no Harambe.,2
Aquarium,So crowded!  It was difficult to move through and covid precautions were literally out the window.  We bought the city pass and it was included so we went.,2
Aquarium,We spent more than 1 hour to wait in the line to get in. I have never seen the aquarium worst like that. I chose this aquarium because of the good reviews. I was wrong.,2
Airport,TSA already knows what they did to that cat,2
Theme Park,They should warn you that 1) half of the food places are open so expect to wait at least an hour and a half if you want to get food at the park 2) wait 45 minutes for the trams to pick you up at the parking 3) wait at least an hour doe each ride,2
Museum,Not as realistic as I had hoped for. Some of the people were not even the correct height.,2
Attraction,Maybe because it was raining! Log waits for everything! Burger wait 45min...,2
Theme Park,"Carving was beautiful. Lot of workers in gift shops were too busy on their phones. Eat at a cafe close to the sky lift, food was cold and very expensive. Park looked like it needed a lot of maintenance work. No one to ask about the history of the carving. Very disappointed for the price",2
Theme Park,You can’t use gift certificates online or over the phone. Love Dolly but they need to catch up with the times.,2
Theme Park,Expect it to be expensive. And long wait lines. Can't get on a ride and video with your child so you can remember how they reacted. And expect your back packs to to searched or purses as well.,2
Airport,Super Busy because blocked off the 1st station.,2
Airport,"For a giant airport, there is so little to do, see and eat.",2
AZM,Staff was very rude …. The safari was an absolute waste of an hour you get closer walking through the zoo. There was trash in the animal’s enclosures it was actually a very depressing experience.,2
Museum,"not as good as expected, I thought it would be more interesting and would be more things to see. The food and drinks was alright but kind of over priced.",2
Airport,"The airport needs to bed updated, the seating areas do NOT have phone ports for today's travelets",2
Airport,Sacramento Airport loves abusing animals. If you want your pet shoved around and thrown go here!,2
Museum,Very underwhelmed with the space center Houston. A lot of pictures with informational paragraphs that I could probably look up online. There were a few cool exhibits but not worth the entry price. I would definitely not come back,2
Aquarium,Too crowded. They should have regulated the crowd presence,2
AZM,Expensive for not much inside would go back since its the newest thing in branson but pretty disappointed by it,2
Aquarium,"Very crowded, photos were too white washed-didnt buy, very hot, some exhibits were closed off",2
Airport,A cat was shoved of a table while in its bag by one of your employees. This should be addressed,2
Airport,Not a lot of food options to eat from like Chicago o hare,2
AZM,Looks like someone stole brees bag with our car Kets from ZooTampa at Lowry Park,2
Aquarium,"One extra star for being somewhat diligent about masking and the general quality of this aquarium. But this place was absurdly crowded, even by pre-pandemic standards let alone the current surge. Simply should not be selling this many tickets",2
Theme Park,Fun park with rude staff. Food is over priced and tasted bad. Staff working food establishments must really hate their job. It just ruins the Lego experience,2
Theme Park,"Over crowded and over priced. We got there at 11AM and park opened at noon. At noon there were already 180 min wait times for rides. Didn't get to ride anything, most shops were closed and performances canceled. Steam train didn't run either.",2
Museum,"We loved the museum! There's so much to see and learn, BUT my husband's coat (and another guest's coat) was stolen! Apparently this is happening more often than not, so why isn't there anything being done to prevent this?  DO NOT LEAVE YOUR COATS ON THE COAT RACKS!!!",2
Airport,Delta in ATL is slow of service and poor of cleanliness. I was disappointed that they did not have many dining options which appealed to me in this terminal.,2
Museum,"I really wanted to like this place, but it seemed very overpriced. Several of the animals in the farm area seemed unhappy and afraid of people. We much prefer the nc zoo, the nc aquariums, and the sylvan heights bird park.",2
Airport,"Slow travel day.  Many restaurants, kiosks and stores closed presumably due to COVID.",2
Museum,Only a handful of the characters looked like the real person. It was a lot of $$ also. I am local & it was pricey. Would Not recommend this attraction!,2
Theme Park,"Most of the employees were not friendly and some incredibly rude. I understand dealing with the public is hard, but being hateful isn't necessary.",2
Aquarium,"Like most places depending on many service workers, it wasn't great. So much has changed since Covid-19. I'm more inclined to stay home.",2
Airport,I’m waiting for a United Airlines Flight to Denver in Terminal A.  There are several people who are not wearing masks.  No one seems to be reinforcing the mask mandate.,2
Airport,Would not recommend going through this airport unless absolutely necessary. Much to busy and gates are quite far from eachother at times. Customer service overall is subpar.,2
Airport,Wheelchair requested. Nowhere to be seen. Staff shortage.,2
Airport,It was during holiday season and it was crowded with lots of delays.,2
Airport,The signs that direct you to parking or pick up are not far or repeated enough,2
Airport,Needs more seating everywhere!!!,2
Airport,Needs way more social distancing implemented as everyone was crowding together. Took over an hour to get through security Dec. 29th and people were missing their flights. There were also no restaurants available to buy food from for early flights in the Spirit terminal.  Restrooms were decent.,2
Airport,Need expletive signs in the parking deck on how to navigate ground level to Domestic North Terminal .,2
Museum,"The virtual reality ride only had one working. After wasting 20-30 minutes in line, the one we were one was broken. The screen was distorted the entire time",2
Aquarium,You need to salt your front steps! It is dangerously slippery and people are falling exiting the building,2
Airport,Landed at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport only to be told that there is only one crew that can park a plane at the gate so we just get to chill for 30 minutes…. Just a full 737 sitting here with weak air conditioning…. Fun…. Or some other F word…..,2
AZM,"Very expensive price, because you can only buy a twin ticket with another tourist site. Impossible to buy only a ticket for sea life, it&#39;s a forced sale 😣",2
Theme Park,"Not many rides, lines can take a long time to move at most rides, lots of walking and hills and super hot in the summer due to no shading. Good thing about the park is the food is decently priced and good. Not worth the trip from NYC, would rather spend the day at a Lego discovery center.",2
Airport,"At the International terminal, after a long flight from Europe, you need to wait minimum one hour at the passport check 
Toilets are missing",2
Airport,It was ok. Not enough Assist Helpers to help people with disabilities get to their gate.,2
Airport,"Confusing, if I wasn't disabled and needed a wheelchair we would have never made our flight.",2
Theme Park,I like Silver Dollar City in Branson MO much more...,2
AZM,Disappointed that the Florida exhibit was closed but looking forward to when it opens,2
Airport,There are virtually no benches outside baggage claim to wait for your ride so people either stand there or sit on the ground. Biggest design flaw ever,2
Museum,Nothing like Cape Canaveral Kiddy stuff everything digital and virtual reality stuff. a lot on the ISS though,2
Airport,Has to wait on the plane for 25 mins for the ground people to show up so the plane could park. At 11:00 pm you expect this things not to happen. Oh well.,2
Aquarium,"Great place if you can come when it isn't busy. Some of the things here you just can't see or enjoy at all becuase of the crowds, especially if groups of kids are here and they aren't supervised well/under control.",2
Airport,No seats near check-in and bag claim. Fast interterminal train connection,2
Airport,I travelled to Atlanta from Florida west palm beach and this airport is a mess just a maze one train to go here then go there the TSA is lazy when there huge line they are sitting in the chair taking and gossiping taking one customer slowly as possible the restaurants close by 6 pm literally just awful the reason they deserve my 3 star because my flight was on time avoid this airport at all cost,2
AZM,"45 miles North, and only $10 per person more, is the Wonders of Wildlife...100 times bigger and better.
My wife and I travel for a living,visiting many aquariums, and this place is way too high and way too small.",2
Zoo,"Came here for zoo lights and it was not great. The parking lot was sheer chaos, like worse than Costco. The staff wasn't able to direct the crowd to the fact that there were three lines for ticket holders to go through so more chaos. Not a great experience.",2
Garden,Real dirty floors but they were replacing them this winter,2
Theme Park,Now you know that this 30 year old Coca Cola from Dollywood tastes nasty now! 😆,2
AZM,I don’t know if it’s the season or timing was an issue but everything either wasn’t open or out of order. Pretty disappointed. At least 6-8 attractions had no animals… very weird.,2
Airport,"TSA was slow, disorganised despite a very small line. Damaged my ipad through careless handling of trays and didn't seem to care at all. Such a shame considering other staff at the airport being so good.",2
Museum,"Worst food I have ever had at a
Food court. Three entrees , all bland, all gross. Skip the food while you’re here.",2
Airport,"Hands down the worst TSA checkpoints of any international airport! Work smarter not harder, they got everybody crammed into one security checkpoint like idiots. Why not have, like most airports do, a TSA security checkout point for each airline??! Things would run much smoother and efficient. These lines should not take hours to go through. Y’all have made this process extremely annoying.",2
Airport,I don't know if it's the overnight flight or what this Airport smell like backed up raw sewage 🤮,2
AZM,"Just visited on 21/01/2022. Due to on going upgrading works, footpaths from Inbian trans station was diverted, but directional sign are very bad provided or non seen",2
Airport,No precheck when coming from an international flight very limited options for food after 7PM. Boarding protocols were ignored main cabin getting on before delta one etc.,2
Museum,"Bad experience
Unfortunately tickets purchased through TripAdvisor were not recognized by the Houston Space Center system.  The goodwill of one of the employees helped me get in.",2
Zoo,They really need to make sure they say something on their site saying exhibits are closed and most were 😡 not a good experience at all ..went today and will never go back to this zoo !!!,2
Attraction,"Vegetarians Beware
If you're a vegetarian, be sure to bring your own food. There are no veggie options in the park, which is shocking, given the abundance of alternative meats like Impossible and Beyond Burgers. One place had tofu ramen, but it was in a chicken broth.",2
Theme Park,The price for admission is getting too high when they expect you to buy stuff inside the park,2
Theme Park,Man they literally just keep ruining Dollywood they’ve taken out so much stuff that made it worth going now this place isn’t worth 10 bucks they’ve just ruined it and continue to ruin it 🥺🤦‍♂️,2
Museum,"If you get the City Pass you can skip this one.  It was really boring, not exciting at all as far as museums go(the Shedd Aquarium is much better). Literally fell asleep during the 3D movie. Won’t be going back. A great time waster though!",2
Airport,"Massive airport, don't arrive an 1 hour before your flight you will miss it.",2
Airport,"How do so many beggars and vagrant's get into the airport in the ""secure"" luggage claim areas????????????",2
Aquarium,"$90 for 2 people.  Didn't find out until we got inside that the dolphin performance was not open.  Mask police everywhere, but most employees said nothing.  Not worth the money. We were out in less than 2 hours",2
Airport,"I have found the Bermuda Triangle. It’s called Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

If I ever get outta here
If we ever get outta here",2
Aquarium,"Had tickets for 2:30, arrived at 2:05 and there was a 2hr West to get in!!! They clearly oversold/mismanaged the tickets.",2
Attraction,Kind of disappointing. Way overpriced for what it is. The lego sculptures are amazing but I would say tickets should be about 1/2 of what they are charging.,2
AZM,"It can&#39;t be helped because it&#39;s indoors, but it&#39;s surprisingly small and crowded with children. It took a long time to line up for vehicles. The food is also expensive. It was rattle on weekdays.",2
Airport,No where close to smoke a cig so I wasn't able to smoke one between flights. That really sucks!!!!!,2
Aquarium,"They need to have more signs,to direct everybody to the right shows if it wasn't for someone from the sea lions company who helped us reserve a seat for the next show if not will never see it.",2
Garden,"Don't know if it's because we came in winter, but this was extremely boring and everything was dead. Most anticlimactic place I've been to in years",2
Airport,"The airport was good , Spirit airlines good a little rough on the seats bit good...NOW the baggage crew , 🤮 fire all of them...",2
Zoo,"They have areas down. Construction going on. Not as good as I thought.
Most animals in I guess cause of the weather.",2
Airport,"They need evacuate 
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport 

Cause somebody pussy stink in ya 🤧🤧",2
Airport,"It's still the worst airport:
1. Processing at checkpoint. Having TSA-Pre here is like going to the regular check start of the line to finish 15 minutes. Only 1 agent works, and 2 more are watching the other how they work.
2. Restroom sanitation is very disappointing as always.
3. People affection is also down. Like they have come to work to make someone's day worse than what they have it.",2
Airport,"Nothing was open when my plane arrived Thurs night. As we left Sunday, dunking donuts wasn't open. Why wouldn't a donut place be open in the morning?",2
Airport,"If you’re on Delta then avoid ATL and take the DTW Detroit routes.

This place is always a mess and it takes a part of your soul to transfer through it.  Detroit feels like a mystical oasis",2
AZM,Part of the exhibits weren't able to be seen and rides were clised..  No notice of this on website at time we decided to take grandchild. Feel there should've been a reduction in $44 admission that is charged for whole park.,2
Theme Park,Outside of all the racist monuments and horrible customer service at the gate. The mountain is great to climb,2
Airport,"Not so friendly here, been through here before, I am not sure what changed so much.  Some of the businesses I walked past they were preparing to open.  Music was very loud rough lyrics.",2
Airport,I love the airport ..but most of my interactions with airport staff are not pleasant . TSA is rude and terrible.,2
Aquarium,"Can someone explain why there are Tshirtd hanging on the walls that the staff refuse to get down and sell you???
We asked 2x for this pink shirt in the size we needed and we were told they would not sell items on the wall.
FYI parents they also force you through the gift  shop just to exit.",2
Airport,"The absolute worst Wi-Fi of any airport! SAT has great Wi-Fi, FLL has great Wi-Fi. RDU has great Wi-Fi, Nashville has great Wi-Fi, even Memphis has great Wi-Fi. Meanwhile, ATL, one of the busiest airports in the world has the worst Wi-Fi possible. The only reason they got 2 stars instead of just one is because they have a Chick-Fil-A in their food court, and that is awesome!",2
Aquarium,"Was super excited to go here but when we got here, they forced us take and put on masks. $40 per person to wear masks all day? No thank you. I understand that might be their policy, but it is my right to refuse to go somewhere that infringes on my human rights. We left.",2
Aquarium,Where have all the fish gone? Most if the tanks were scarcely filed. It was disappointing.,2
Airport,All lots were full had to park outside the airport. That's ridiculous.,2
Airport,"I personally don't like this airport. I belive it could be structured better. It is very chaotic and often has happened that the train didn't stop to the proper exit or not at all.
It has great potential but again...if I can avoid to fly there, I do avoid it",2
Aquarium,Quite poor compared to the price Lack of experience and can be viewed in an hour. Ocean Science Museum is better.,2
Aquarium,(Translated by Google) Not as good as they say (Original),2
Airport,"Haha TSA here does not have time for your BS. We were on a connecting flight and the TSA agents were just, "" take everything out of your pockets, ma'am, is he gonna push your bag? No? Then stay with your bag"". It was pretty entertaining to watch.",2
Aquarium,"Not worth the price of admission for what they showcase. If you have never been to an aquarium, you may enjoy it. However, the price is still steep for the experience!",2
Airport,Why'd they take away the smoking area?? 😭,2
Zoo,"We love the zoo, but I would like to know why my disabled six year old son was not allowed to enter the ape building today? He is not able to wear a useless mask! Not happy at all that he was turned away.",2
Zoo,to crowded not enough shade.  animals are hard to view,2
Zoo,Why should I have to pay full price because of covid-19 restrictions to only be able to be at the zoo for a couple of hours according to the time blocks. That seems extremely unfair. Those that can't get a Time block till after 3:00 should not be charged full price.,2
Zoo,It was snowing and place felt closed. Masks are an issue with my asthma so I recommend waiting if your in the same boat,2
Zoo,The COVID restrictions are extreme. Can't walk around outside maskless without being reprimanded by an employee. Almost impossible to get a bite to eat...a few walk up snack windows only. I won't be back.,2
Zoo,It’s a bit frustrating that they require masks throughout the entire zoo even though you are out doors most of the time. They also try to pass it off as if the mandate were still in effect and it’s not. Don’t get after people to put on their mask if nobody is within 30 feet of them!,2
Zoo,"Very small zoo for the price - we were done in an hour. Bring your patience for Parking. Crowds galore with barely any Covid precautions or considerations  - we saw one hand sanitizer stand (perhaps there were more, just too many people around). Hardly any signs to tell you about the animals.",2
Zoo,Way overpriced when my 34 week pregnant self can walk the whole zoo in an hour and a half. I'm no expert on how habitats should be set up but the larger animals (cats mainly) seem to have been in small exhibits. Definitely will not be returning.,2
Zoo,I think they should be open longer because people  are not going to go when it's hot,2
Zoo,Didn't have any misters for cooling off and the hand sanitizers were only by the consessions.,2
Zoo,Don’t know what happened here.  The remodel I think has been it’s downfall.  And the moving of some exhibits to another location.  No shows at all.  Some informative employees.  Animals are never active.,2
Zoo,(Translated by Google) More than half of the zoo was closed that day (Original) More than half of the zoo was closed that day,2
Zoo,"People not wearing masks, sanitizers not working or empty, train broken down. No bird show, it used to be the highlight. Too many animals missing. Just not the fun zoo of the passed. Grandkids liked the water feature.",2
Zoo,Why you all not bring back wax figure smash machine?,2
Zoo,"most of the animals are sleeping, this is the smallest scale zoo that I saw.",2
Airport,"Check-in is confusing, they take you all the way around to get to security gates and it waste lots of time.",2
Airport,Rarely any covid-19 guidelines are being practiced so fly as safely as possible nobody is ever seen disinfecting between guests or customers. Bathrooms becoming like sewers. So bring your own cleaning wipes & sprays. People are at times not wearing masks remotely properly 😒 🙄,2
Airport,A little old looking in some places,2
Airport,"Love ATL However, the lines to get to security are ludicrous. 12 lanes but only three open. 1500 people trying to fly all over the world and we're cattle.",2
AZM,"it's impossible to buy a ticket just for the aquarium, you are forced to buy a combo including the horrible wax dolls museum.... this kind of commercial behaviour is reluctant.
So, you'd better go somewhere else.",2
Museum,Very busy. Way too much money to wait in long lines. Too many weight limits and too many restrictions. Several attractions out of service.,2
Aquarium,"Extremely crowded. You were constantly being pushed, so it was hard to enjoy.😔",2
AZM,To expensive and a little fun! I would come back 😒,2
Attraction,"Was sad to see half the rides not working, food carts closed. So many people trying to eat and take their children on rides rather disappointing to not have everything working/open.",2
Aquarium,"Decent selection of sea creatures, but underwhelming. Also, no mask policy in effect.",2
Aquarium,It was way too crowded to enjoy any of the exhibits. The timed entry does nothing to help this fact.,2
AZM,"Great place to take the whole family, if you like to walk around and see only a few animals. I estimate about 80% of the outdoor exhibits had signs apologizing for the lack of animals. I get that it’s too cold for them, but give us some warning. 😢",2
AZM,"It is a beautiful place but the animals are in very bad condition, they should be fed well, the animals are not happy to be there",2
Airport,"I realize it's a Sunday night, but you have all these flights still coming and going, and no place open to get food???",2
Airport,Not resly a lot going on at the airport.,2
Museum,"Half of the machines don’t work correctly or are so old they aren’t fun. (One of the games was a early 2000s Microsoft flight simulator)

The weight requirements are 250 so if you’re big and not an kid you’re going to be rather bored.

I basically paid $32 for a half working arcade.",2
Theme Park,"Hotel
The staff was very nice. the Hotel is a dump. Our room had a shower that didn't work well. Faucet coming out of the wall ! . Restaurants were filthy ! Food on floor and tables. Floor was sticky. We had a 4 day trip planned. We left after only 2.",2
Airport,Concourse A always being packed with delta airlines.,2
AZM,Ok for small children because it's small. Otherwise very mediocre.,2
Attraction,"Toooo crowded!!!! Understaffed
Lower your entry #'s if you can't handle it",2
AZM,I have mixed feelings. It was very expensive and half the rides were closed. The animal exhibits were okay. Five or six animals weren't in there cages.,2
Theme Park,"45 minutes to get parked.  Not a good start to the day.  Long waits at concessions, over half of which are closed.  Service and experience training needed throughout the park.",2
Theme Park,"Everything was closed! On the website, only the Ariel tram was closed.",2
Airport,First time to Atlanta airport was disappointing.  We were starving...it was around dinner time.  The only sit-down restaurant open was Longhorn.  Long line...packed.  the Italian restaurant was serving drinks only.,2
Airport,Chaos at arrivals with contradiction between assistants.,2
Attraction,"Fun Lego themes, best value for use of rides would be for children 8-12 food services across the park did not start until later in the day.",2
Airport,Need more food places open early,2
Airport,Directions to the airport terminal a little complicated likewise picking up the shuttle,2
Airport,My luggage was damaged . Not cool at all..Filed a baggage claim with Delta Airlines,2
Theme Park,Nice hotel setup - but much improvement needed with staffing and training; hospitality.,2
Airport,No rest rooms or portable toilets  clean lot,2
Aquarium,Normally aquarium is nice visit. Went today to see mermaids and was not a good experience ..try waiting in line with toddlers for an hour to see ONE mermaid,2
Theme Park,Disappointed the sky ride and mountain were the only things open still had to pay full price,2
Aquarium,I still would get in my car and drive to the Tennessee Aquarium 10 times better,2
Attraction,So to avoid crowds I bought tickets for my family online for a weekday 3/1/22  but all the places to eat were closed! several attractions were closed also the only food that we were able to get was over at the castle hotel outside of Lego land.,2
AZM,Most of the exhibits were closed and the ticket was expensive compared to a much bigger and better zoo back in d.c,2
Sports,Had to wait more then 10 mins for some nuggets. So my fries wasn't that hot .,2
Airport,"Keep having problems with Southwest Airlines n TSA, losing my things.",2
Airport,Long way to rideshare and baggage claim,2
AZM,Very disappointed in the amount of animals that we didn't get to see. It was a beautiful day and enjoyed my family but overall disappointed in the zoo!,2
Airport,I’ve been stuck at this airport more times than Bubba said “shrimp” in the movie Forrest Gump.,2
Airport,Too busy for me! Give your self plenty of time to get to your terminal. And getting a rental car on the weekend is painful.,2
Aquarium,Drove all the way down to be turned aways because had no reservations.  Didn't know,2
Airport,Not bad traffic was hectic and people parking everywhere they are not supposed to...,2
Zoo,"Where are all the animals?!? It seems like half the habitats are empty or being renovated. You'd think the prices wouldn't be so high. Plan on parking being difficult, especially past late morning. At least parking is free. I wish the experience attractions weren't so crowded.",2
Aquarium,It was a little weird having to go through a metal detector to get in.,2
Airport,"Now days start getting of traffic to/ from it. Add extra time for traffic delays on i5 by the downtown due to construction. And leaving the airport can be a pain, we seen accidents to i5.",2
Theme Park,"🦋☃️🏔Heads Up delayed opening tomorrow @Dollywood🥶
#JoeKnowsSnow",2
Aquarium,"Really I the people of the aquarium did a good job, but is not fair that you have to spend 3 or 4 hours to se the shows. They have to check how many people can enter to the aquarium because is a lot of people and in that way nobody can enjoy. For me I was very disappointed with this experience.",2
Museum,Some of the large animals werent out to be seen but that happens sometimes,2
AZM,"Room for Improvement
There were a couple of zebras and a few giraffes, and no Rhino which was in their advertising. Not worth $27.",2
Theme Park,Great park to visit if you don’t eat or drink. Most of the food places were closed. None of the water fountains worked. I waited longer for a hot dog than to actually ride a roller coaster.,2
Airport,"Where was MARTA when I needed them to pick me up, and my car, and get us from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to I-985. Me and my heart rate need my mountain life. At least the Atlanta Braves now have a north county site. 👏",2
Aquarium,Vancouver Aquarium & Greater Vancouver Zoo  bro stop using animals for entertainment,2
Theme Park,"Terrible
Very unorganized. At the park 5 hours road 2 rides, over half of the restaurants and snack stands closed yet you pay full price for admission. Never again!!!",2
Aquarium,"I don’t think the tickets warrant the price. It doesn’t seem like the price increases are going towards maintaining, let alone improving, the aquarium and it definitely isn’t going towards workers salaries.",2
Museum,"Although the place is very educational and interesting, it was a disappointment because some things were closed or already sold out even though we arrived early.",2
Theme Park,Half of the shops and food venues were closed. Some of the bigger rides were closed. The lines were hours long for everything. Capacity should be limited if staffing is an issue. It was a complete waste of money.,2
Theme Park,Lines are too long takes two hours just to get your ticket only two booths are open smh waist of money not that many rides like they claim on tv takes one hour just to get on one ride smh I will not be going back,2
Theme Park,Was kind of disappointed. Seemed like most stuff was closed for various non covid reasons.  Didn't feel like thry were prepared for opening.,2
Theme Park,"Don't worth the money. Attractions are constantly closed and some with 180min wait time. Park didn't allow you to bring food, but they have no infrastructure to support the guests. Don't waste your $$",2
Museum,"Lots to do, but was packed full of people and lines inside. Some rides were too long and some too short. Great for kids in the 6-10 age group.",2
AZM,Overpriced for what it is. The one in Springfield is x100 times better.,2
Theme Park,"Please, first, hire more people to run all of your food stations. Second, hire people who work with some urgency. Third, set them up for success by improving your processes (e.g. have more (many more) than one fountain drink spout for a food court with 150 people eating and a 100 people in line!)",2
Aquarium,The animals looked sad and the tanks were dirty. I didn’t like the layout of the place. It felt more like a zoo than aquarium.,2
Theme Park,Crazy expensive!!!! Been to cheaper parks and better. My husband and son waited two hours for a ride that had mechanical issues . It was very packed! The cinnamon bread was delicious! Muffin in Starbucks was good. The kettle taco chips were good. Won't return though,2
Theme Park,The park was cool but lines were terrible. Ticket line was not efficient. None of the food stations were fully staffed. Employees at Kickin’ Chicken were rude despite our patience and politeness with them.,2
Theme Park,legoland I love you but you have to do something about the food lines.  waiting an hour and 45 minutes for a cheese pizza is insane.,2
Airport,"The prideful ""World's Busiest Airport"" can often read, ""The World's Most Chaotic Airport with the dirtiest gate areas on the planet when ATC/Weather delays hit during peak travel times.More travelers means more revenue means more hands on deck... it's simple math, ATL!!!",2
Aquarium,A lot of the fish are severely unhealthy and under cared for..,2
Aquarium,Not enough handicap parking. Had to walk forever to park when we have handicap,2
Aquarium,Pretty boring. And their signs are not clear at all. Plus very little wheelchair accessibility. They need to renovate the entire place with ramps or install more elevators.,2
Theme Park,"Disney is better! Lines are slow . Food is slow. Yes there were less crowds but most employees moved so slow which made lines take longer than an hr.   On the bright side , my kids did enjoy it but not as much as Disney World.",2
Theme Park,"Love Dollywood, however very pricey.  A lot of food places were closed making extremely long lines at the ones that was open.  As much money as season passes are, we should have all food options to choose from.  Highly disappointed in wait times.",2
Airport,For an airport of this size it's chaotic! The 2 stars are for the staff who are helpful.,2
Airport,At what point can we stop funding the TSA?,2
Aquarium,"I want impressed at all.Giant place with lots of wasted space.Very confusing layout inside, makes it difficult and frustrating to locate anything. I suggest they close it and put up billion dollar condo's for Black Obama's friends to visit his god awful library",2
Museum,They don't explain how the all access pass works so we didn't scan right for an activity and the worker told us it wasn't her problem. To buy another ticket,2
Theme Park,"- Great hike, but the park's refusal to remove the rebel flag is spineless and disappointing. 🤡",2
Aquarium,Was enjoying my day until I overheard some employees talking about how they have to pay to park at their own jobs??? I get that yall don't have a designated parking lot that's just yours but pushing that expense onto the employees?? That's just wrong.,2
AZM,"It was quite crowded. The attractions were lined up and it was a 3-hour system, so it was a little unsatisfactory.",2
Airport,"Drop-off at the South Terminal is a mess. It appears there was little thought as to how to organize passenger drop-off and then when they realized that passengers were figuring it out themselves their answer was to block off lanes so only the ""lucky"" people could get to the curb.  To be the busiest airport in the world, I expect better planning!",2
Attraction,"Just an okay trip
Our son is autistic and I did not feel like the park was able to meet his needs what so ever. It was unfortunate because we were there for his birthday.",2
AZM,"It was nice but, overpriced. Way overpriced. $83 for two people. Go to the aquarium at Bass Pro in Springfield. MUCH better and you won’t leave with severe buyer’s remorse.",2
Aquarium,"Feb. Visit
Seemed more for children.  Very crowded.  Expensive for what is offered.  Long lines for shark Bridge.   Took our time, but there was not much to see.",2
AZM,"The aquarium is aesthetically pleasing.. however, there is little variety in species, small tanks, and rude staff. Would recommend driving to Springfield to the Bass Pro aquarium. Way too overpriced!",2
Museum,"This place needs revamping. The price is high, and the attractions are low. A little interesting, but dated. Save yourself the headache if it is crowded!",2
Airport,Not much open.  Very limited menu in the T area.  Burger & pizza only things I saw hot to eat.  Best thing about this airport-flying away.,2
Attraction,"Need more restaurants open
We spent too much time looking for cold bottle water.  Only 2 restaurants were open which wasn’t enough. Long waits for food",2
AZM,Small zoo and tiny enclosures. Parking isn't well organized and once all of those people are packed into a tiny zoo it is super crowded. Not impressed at all. Zoo management should visit San Diego or Omaha to see how they do it.,2
Attraction,Was disappointed with the wait time to go on any ride.,2
Airport,"I swear I give this airport a try every year or at least every other year.  Not much improvement still.  However, I did notice they added something in the concourse to make your walk a little more pleasant.  Check out the video.  It's an OK airport but not my fav..  Just seems unorganized and dirty.  We saw 2 roaches while walking the concourse.",2
Theme Park,Their trolly system sucks for disabled people. Need more handicap parking 👌,2
Aquarium,The dolphin show was so crowded they had the nerve to talk social distancing. That couldn't be done.,2
Aquarium,"Way too expensive for what it was, pretty disappointing",2
Theme Park,"They need to get it together, many fun things to do with the kids, but they need better maintenance and happier warmer welcomes. Their burger restaurant was full and out of Coke, Fanta, Sprite [...] syrups during lunch  rush hours.",2
Aquarium,"I couldn't see the dolphin show, because I had to book and I found out there and everything was full.",2
Museum,I was rather disappointed with this location of WonderWorks. We had previously visited the Panama City location and loved it. This location had a lot of activities that didn’t work.,2
Attraction,"Never returning
Superrrrrrr long line to get into all the rides. We rushed through lunch to get to more rides and even then it didn’t help. Some rides had a short line which you imagined would be a short 10-15 minute wait time, nope, 55 minutes!!!",2
Airport,If this the best airport I would hate to see a medium or worst,2
Airport,"This pictures are from Friday March 25th 2022, I can’t understand why mask are not properly used for all airport users, including this night passengers…",2
AZM,It's ok. Crowded and smaller than expected. Most of the animals we came to see were not in their exhibits so left disappointed.,2
Zoo,Paths are not very well marked and a lot of exhibits are showing serious disrepair,2
Theme Park,Three-hour waits for popular rides and two hours for food killed any positive experiences. Invest in line-management tech that assigns arrival times for rides and allows advance ordering for food at specified pickup times. It's not rocket science and it frees people up to  explore and shop.,2
AZM,The Aquarium in Springfield beats this one. It was short and not that many things to look at. The best thing was the ride and the kids had fun. Rude workers at the end yelling at everybody's kids about what to do and how to touch the rays and star fish.,2
Airport,Precheck TSA on the south terminal was crowded this morning,2
Theme Park,Waited in traffic for 2+ hours to get into the park. Once we got in wait times for food were ridiculous,2
Theme Park,Not a place to go if you are looking for a variety of rides and aren't a roller coaster fan like myself. Almost a 100.00 just for one person.   I was really disappointed.,2
Theme Park,"Never going back most of the park was closed, way overpriced to come in and not have many places to eat or refill your cup, then a man on one of the rides was super rude. I gave it a 2 because a couple rides were fun. Not worth almost 400.00 to get in I'd rather go to Carowinds.",2
AZM,"Not as nice as it used to be!
Employees wearing mask outside didn't make sense.",2
Aquarium,It was nice but a little disappointing Gatlinburg’s was better,2
Attraction,"Declining quality
Legoland has gone down hill. The hotel is in disarray, the park constantly has rides shut down without notice, and many of the amenities are no longer available. It feels like they stopped caring about the park about 5 years ago and have let it ""coast"" since then.",2
Museum,This is just not my kind of place.... Sorry folks... They should set a limit on how many people can enter this place... Much too pricey for what you get... Had to wait in long lines for mediocre attractions,2
Museum,Cool concept but not a lot to do and a very overpriced gift shop. Kids get bored after 20mins every time. I wish it had more because it could be really interesting,2
Theme Park,We love Dolly wood but I will say that this new parking is the absolute worst parking at a theme park I have ever seen. Took us over 30 minutes to just get from the pay booths to the parking spot!!!!!,2
Garden,"If your not an early riser,try not  getting rooms at the end of the hall next to staff closet. House keeping knocked 3 times before checkout",2
Airport,"They don't have enough signs to to direct new travelers, you will be driving down one way streets in what is pretty much a rat maze will the airport employees watch you on a billion cameras but can't assist you in any other way as far as finding your location go earlier than necessary because it's a journey just getting there good luck safe travels",2
Theme Park,"I just asked my wife Bailey, “Did you know Dollywood has some of the best coasters in the country?”
Her response, in all seriousness, was: “Coasters? Like, for coasters for drinks?” 

She’s still laughing about it and I’m thinking the baby has already sucked up most of her smarts.",2
Attraction,"4 good rides in 1 day and that’s it. The rest was waiting in lines. Nonmechanical rides break down all the time. The wait times are wildly inaccurate. The negatives outweigh the benefits, we will not be renewing our memberships.",2
Theme Park,I didn't think it was worth paying $20.00 to park also all the attractions in that park are additional costs. Wouldn't do it over again.,2
Airport,"Security does not move fast enough for the crowds that go through.
It's a HUGE hub and prep yourself for atleast an hour to go from drop off to boarding.",2
Airport,Busy and food lines and prices are not reasonable. But it is kept clean.,2
Airport,Avis Car Rental I think you need to hire more employees at the San Antonio International Airport !,2
Attraction,"I thought it was only okay.

It was pretty expensive. The upsells are out of control.  The lines are pretty crazy long.  The attractions are only okay.  I was a little bit surprised by the few things that were closed and also the things that didn't quite work correctly.",2
Attraction,"Legoland, ok for kid, expensive, seaworld is a better choice
Not a lot of stuff to do, expensive parking, extra charge for water park with very limited water playground. Extra charge for aquarium. The ticket itself is already at high price it should include all the attractions already.",2
Zoo,"Most Depressing Zoo ever. Only saw about 30 animals out of supposed 800,
And the ones that were out looked sick or very sad.
The aquarium was much much better.",2
Airport,"This airport has fallen off the mark.  I'm sure some of the Internal ""blight"" (closed shops and restaurants) has something to do with worker shortages etc., but it actually made me sad to see it in such a state with less activity.  I'm hopeful for a brighter future for Hartsfield as we slowly return to normalcy.",2
Airport,CLEAR line moves a little slow so get there early.,2
Airport,Shuttle bus broke down had to wait for replacement busses.  A bit slow.,2
Theme Park,"Underwhelming mini golf course. If you just want to waste an hour and don’t really care about the course, then this is the place for you. It’s clean but way overpriced for the quality. The holes were plain, boring, not many obstacles, and didn’t get that “Oh! This one is cool!” effect.",2
AZM,Some of the rides were closed and the stingrays were gone. 😔,2
Zoo,"Day at Utah's Hogle Zoo, a bit rusty with the live animal sketching",2
Airport,"The airport has the most annoying music early morning. I was waiting for my flight and they had this techno, weird music. I just wanted to sleep and rest. Couldnt do it. Plus they had someone vacuum around everybody. It was too much.",2
Garden,"The family enjoyed the experience. We reserved a Deluxe Villa but placed in  Standard upon arrival. No other accommodations available at the time. Charged Deluxe rate at check out. Manager(s) ""Cindy or Angela"", would not refund the difference.",2
Theme Park,Only the 1st half of this course is kind of handicap accessible but they don't tell you that when you buy their tickets.,2
Airport,"Anybody else frequently fly to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and have to wait FOREVER for your bags? I get that they’re the busiest airport but they don’t even put priority bags first, most likely cuz I fly American Airlines and ATL is a Delta Air Lines hub 🥹🤌🏼🙃",2
Airport,Couldn't find a cup of coffee on our layover at 6:00 am in the morning.,2
Zoo,If not for the cute penguins and river otters I would give it no stars for the manner in which they house the elephants and tigers. Totally unacceptable,2
Theme Park,"Long lines, very expensive to go to and did not get to ride very much in the time we were there due to the lines.",2
AZM,"You spend a lot of money for a 30 minute walk through. It was $99 for 2 adults, 1 kid. The aquarium looks a whole lot bigger than what it is. It's literally 1 tank but you see it from like 5 different views. It was nothing special.",2
Theme Park,The animals are very few. The ones they have looked sick.   Not very well fed. Rides are decent when they work. Short ride time with Short lines.lol the food is so expensive 14.oo for a elephant ear. 5.00 for a soda.  15.00 for parking.,2
Airport,"The airport is not well directed . Really short staffed , and late because of not enough workers. I know everyone needs help but almost lost our flight time due to being short staffed.",2
Theme Park,"So many rides were closed for a Saturday, the two main roller coasters, the rapids ride, the log ride, and so many more was very disappointing.",2
Museum,"Need more hands on exhibits and/or rides that come with the price of admission. Definitely needs an expansion.  Little kids, 2nd grade, were bored during their field trip.",2
Museum,It's okay....  several of the exhibits didn't work.  No sure if it is worth the cost.  Waited in line for almost everything.  Most likely would never go back.,2
Airport,The most ridiculously difficult airport in the world!  Hate it!,2
AZM,"A little disappointed, so many habitats are empty. Didn't see any bears.",2
Museum,"No one checked our tickets, not sure I should have bought them!",2
Aquarium,Too many people. Felt like an NYC subway car. My family could not stop and watch the exhibits due to the inexorable flow of traffic.,2
Theme Park,Honestly I loved and hated this.. the inside rides were great! And all the small kid rides were cute. But the bigger rides in the castle area took FOREVER just to make sure everyone was buckled and right height. Also the main rides broke SO often.,2
Theme Park,They charge now for 2 year old admission. Over 100 per person. Would not let us buy peppa world and legoland together as advertised. Wound up having to pay almost 1000 for both places for family of 6. Cannot believe they charge a full price admission for a 2 year old!,2
Airport,It's very expensive! This was my first time here. I prepaid for parking weeks before my trip. I didn't know the people I paid was a different company from the airport. Apparently I parked in the wrong spot and had to pay an extra $216!,2
Airport,Not enough clear directions throughout the airport. Not enough signs to direct you.,2
Zoo,"Most of the place was closed
During a cold winter day, most of the attractions (and restaurants) are closed, the animals in their interior shelters and the overall feel of the zoo is kind of sad. Not worth it for the price of entrance.",2
Zoo,"I am only giving 2 stars because there was so much construction it was a mess, the food was disgusting,  The chicken tender and fries that I had gotten tasted disclose the chicken tenders tasted like fishy it was horrible and it was the worst experience I've had in such a long time.",2
Museum,A lot of the activies did not work.  Snack area was not reasonably priced.,2
Museum,We were so excited and enthusiastic start. That quickly deteriorated as we realized how long the lines were.  30 - 40 minutes  (if not more) for the bigger attractions.  If you're good with that than you might like it!,2
Aquarium,Not as impressed as I thought I would be.  Definitely overrated.,2
Attraction,"The place is awesome, except the waiting time , 80 min+  When LEGOLAND working hours is  10am to 5 pm only you will be able to ride in 3-4 attractions maximum.",2
Airport,"Just barely worthy of catching your connecting flights. Crowded, muggy, messy and charging stations at seats don’t work. Even the wall outlet I found didn’t work. Currently my least favorite airport.",2
Museum,Not worth the price. The only cool thing was the Egyptian exhibit but everything else was a let down. The health exhibit was the biggest let down because none of the machines worked. I would recommend just going to the art museum.,2
Zoo,Hard to see animals... all the birds were not there.... From the many Zoos I have been to definitely the worst but gave it 2 stars because it was free....,2
Aquarium,"Came from indiana to visit family in Kentucky, stopped here on the way home . Not many sharks and over all pretty bland place. U can find some reasonable items in the gift shop but other than that really just not worth the drive",2
Museum,"Disappointed
was kind of disappointed considering what you are charged, been to one in Myrtle Beach and much better. This was good for the most part but very short and expensive.",2
Aquarium,"The way the flow is (or lack there of) is weird. It's just a big cluster. There are some really cool exhibits, but if you don't like large crowds, then this isn't the aquarium to visit.",2
Theme Park,"Not worth the price. Drove up from VA to a big disappointment. Second week of opening for the season, some of the rides were already broken. The rides are woefully understaffed. The time to move people on/off the rides are super slow.",2
Attraction,"Not worth the time and money. They charge Disney prices, but you get a carnival experience.",2
Aquarium,"Long lines,$47/person, The food was expensive and disgusting and The ""shows""were ok!",2
Museum,"(Translated by Google) There is a lot of restriction

(Original)
Hay mucha restricción",2
Museum,Gets way too crowed to have any fun at all with a family. Expensive and smells like urine.,2
Airport,Low amount of food options and narrow walk ways. Little dated and not overly clean.,2
Theme Park,Complete bore for children 8+ . Ever ride is made for two year olds. Long wait. Firefighter show was cringe but the best thing there,2
Airport,"Limited food service , janitor came in and out of restroom without stocking paper towels.",2
AZM,Not very happy. Almost no animals on exhibit. Enclosures for animals looked in very poor condition. Sorry to say looks lime zoo is going down hill.,2
Theme Park,I am a Disabled Veteran from South Carolina and brought my own Scooter and can't go on any rides at all.   But still got charged admission .   Crazy 🤪,2
Attraction,Not open Long enough hours to accomplish everything,2
Airport,"Huge airport! My only complaint is most of the restaurants aren’t open late at night or early mornings, and that’s usually when I pass through. Our last trip we had to grab something from the vending machine, and there wasn’t much of a selection.",2
Airport,TSA in this airport needs to get it together me and my mom were at the airport for over 2 hours and ended missing our flight due to TSA and the long long lines if u are flying and are leaving from this airport show 4 hours prior to your flight cause your going to be in this long TSA line for hours,2
Zoo,"It seems like every time we go here the animals are somewhere else. When they are in their assigned cages, they’re so far away it’s not enjoyable.",2
Aquarium,Not a lot of exhibits or diversity of animals for the price,2
Zoo,"just went there paid 80 bucks for the four of us, bird exhibits were closed, none of the animals looked lively. I am sure the place perks up in the summer.",2
Airport,"Delta people great, TSA where jerks",2
Aquarium,"I don't like changes to GA. The delphine show was short and boring, comparing to the one they had about 5 years ago. Other expositions also changed to the worse.",2
Museum,"Not happy with this experience.
A very poor tour inside the installations, very bad sound quality on the train tour. Very disappointed. The Tour only goes to the Saturn V but I know there is more to see inside.",2
Aquarium,Was disappointed. Expected more because of the advertisement of this aquarium being the 3rd largest in the world.,2
Theme Park,"More for the little kids (6-10) than the big kids. They are really slow turning over the rides, no one working the rides moves with a purpose. Paying $25 for parking on the way out was not a nice send-off.  We will not be returning.",2
Airport,"Inexpensive, but terrible shuttle service. I was passed by two buses on arrival and 4 buses when I returned. When I talked to the driver that finally picked me up he said they are reassigned to different parking lots all the time. I have not experienced this at any other airport.",2
Theme Park,Hardly anything open and paid full price to get in.  The train was down all day because the winds were blowing.  Was so looking forward to the museum and it was gone! Sad experiences!,2
Theme Park,"My 4 year old waited for 94 min for a two min play. If you come here, expect long~~~ wait time. Today 4/20 Wednesday, at least 30-90 min wait for each play.",2
AZM,"Very disappointed. We lived in Pittsburgh, a smaller metro area, with a fantastic zoo (comparatively) with admission less than half that of Tampa's No cats in the Africa section.More stands and kiosks than exhibits $5.00 for a bottle of Coke.Won't be returning anytime soon.",2
Airport,"Normally a great airport experience. This review was affected by the airport construction, reduced train service, and Southwest Airlines lack of personnel. The combination of the three forced me, as a disabled veteran, to painfully walk from the T train exit to baggage claim. It was an excruciating half mile walk. Hope not to have to do it again!",2
Airport,"Not even for cockroaches and rude security, but for the loud music playing all night.",2
Airport,There's no signage for long term parking lot,2
Museum,The lines were very long and it was definitely very chaotic inside,2
Zoo,"I feel bad for most the animals. Most looked   melancholy, and were just standing around. Half the animals weren't there, and the ones that are were just sleeping because they are nocturnal. Me and my girlfriend walked the whole zoo and left pretty disappointed.",2
Zoo,There is a ton of construction going on limiting space on the sidewalks and blocking views.  Many animals cannot be seen.  It was not worth going at this  time.,2
Airport,Wheelchair service was very slow. Baggage claim too. Smh,2
Airport,Who was the genius that came up with the idea that solving the homeless issue of camping at the airport was to get rid of where to sit in the checkin area. The thousand of passengers looking for where to sit thank you. And don’t try sitting on any of many  empty chairs marked handicap unless you want a rude employee asking you to move.,2
AZM,Over half the exhibits were closed for the weather on a 70* sunny day.,2
AZM,I was sad that my favorite ride out of the whole park 😉 was closed most of the rides were closed today because of some thing I don’t know why but hopefully some of these ride will be open next weekends,2
AZM,And also T3 was closed today as well because I think the chain broke on that as well or something,2
Theme Park,Park is definitely suited to younger aged kid.  My 9 year old was less than impressed and he loves legos.  Lines are terrible long and rides are supper short.  We have waited in lines for 6 hours for 6 rides that lasted a total of maybe 10 …,2
Theme Park,"Is to expensive .
Go to Disney or Great woulf lodge.
Parking cost $27 …",2
AZM,"Not enough to see.  Lot of walking, too many empty enclosures.  Boring visit",2
Airport,"It's obviously a monster of an airport. Security was definitely slow, even in the pre check lane. Bathrooms are few and far between in the terminal, which is a bit of a challenge with a kid.

Also, the PlaneTrane was super-full. Felt like the subway in rush hour. Goes to show, bigger is not always better.",2
Theme Park,Kinda disappointed Dollywood has taken all motorcycle parking out -  it would have really been nice to know this before hand when you were announcing all the changes to your parking lot you conveniently  left the part out about removing the motorcycle parking once again very disappointing!,2
Aquarium,Overpriced 40 bucks for a ticket and 10 for parking idk didn’t feel worth it,2
AZM,"Need to post when most of the exhibits are down..  not many animals, and was 150 for 5 tix!",2
Airport,"Layover at the D gates. There are only about 200 seats for 4 gates, or 1,000 passengers. The aisles are full of people. The trash cans are overflowing.",2
Theme Park,Park experience was fun. Food service and park management experience was awful. Customer service was terrible.,2
Theme Park,Excellent park with awful staff. You can tell they hired the entire team from the bottom of the barrel. Lines are hours long. Takes the lazy staff 20 minutes to load a 60 second ride.,2
Zoo,Extremely crowded really wasn't no parking & the  zoo experience walk-threw about hour & 1/2.,2
Airport,Just a forewarning if you have an early flight and are TSA precheck you're better off going to regular security because I just stood completely still in line for 20 minutes in the TSA pre check line. They must not staff that line in the early morning. So give yourself an extra 30 minutes at minimum or you'll be cutting it close like me for my flight.,2
Airport,Very busy Airport. Backed up traffic in the arrival and departure  areas at 12:00 at night. Be prepared to wait in the car line.,2
AZM,"It was a nice place, but the cost is extreme for what you get. I paid nearly $200 for my family to enter. The entire visit was completed in less than 30 mins. Total ripoff.",2
AZM,Don’t go on a weekend if you don’t want to fight three lines. Lol,2
Theme Park,I really thought about going as im here for work next two weeks but 90 dollars for 10-7pm is just not worth it. hell most other parks are open untill 10 at night 7pm is just ridiculous. Lower the ticket if you're gonna have such short operating hours.,2
Theme Park,Food is terrible and terribly overpriced.   No shade.  Rides had a 2 hour wait when the place is only open 10-5.   I would be ok if the price was half but at 80+ definitely not worth it.   Needs a lot of improvement,2
Museum,Looks interesting but the prices are a bit steep to say the least. I dont understand why these tourist places want to charge so much.,2
Attraction,"Park is run down in many places.  Especially the ""classic attractions"" like Coast Cruise, Fairytale Boats and Miniland.  Star Wars Miniland has been removed for whatever reason and my sons' absolute favorite there ""Knight's Tournament"" has been dug out.  So disappointed with our visit last week.",2
Theme Park,We went on Sunday in mid April hoping to avoid the crowd but Dollywood was still too crowded to enjoy.,2
Museum,"My only complaint is that they're too focus now on gear and book for girls, which is ok to encourage girls to become astronauts
(I love it) but please do not take it away for boys. It was hard for us to find a book for boys for our baby boy to read.",2
Theme Park,Thought would be more real craftsmen experiences food over priced did enjoy train ride map very confusing ? Didn't ride coasters little too old for that all staff very friendly and helpful my opinion ?,2
Aquarium,Was insanely busy when we went and staff was grouchy. Especially the 2 ladies in the gift shop area.,2
Theme Park,"Not much open yet
Cold rainy day made the visit less enjoyable. Shows were not open because of that. The food is very average. Eat before you go.",2
Airport,They have started construction yet again with parking now even further than before. Don't help every month there's a new route within the property so forget 2 hours early.. Now you have to do 3 or 4. So much for convenience!!!,2
Museum,$30 per person is a bit steep. Can't see a family with 4 kids dropping $180 plus food to go there.,2
Aquarium,"PARKING IS ATROCIOUS!!! Couldn't find a parking spot so missed my call time for entry, on top of that there were perfectly good parking spots blocked off. Took me 10 yrs to visit after moving here and will probably be another 10 b4 I'm back.",2
AZM,"Do NOT LIKE the new DIGITAL PASS this year.
I go to swim. I love the exercise I get at Hurricane Bay.
I DO NOT rent a locker. I don’t think I should be FORCED to take my phone.
I’m a local senior who just goes to swim.",2
AZM,Most of the animals were not not due to construction.,2
Museum,"Recent visit has many closed exhibits, no petting zoo, somehow electronic screen still on the login screen. One computer hooked up to the internet so that you could search Google freely. Not the same as it used to be; real shame.",2
Garden,"Waited for the tulips to bloom, but they were all sectioned off for events. I wish the gardens would advertise when you aren't allowed to walk by the blooming areas so you wouldn't waste your time coming. Meanwhile the rest of the garden looks desolate.",2
AZM,"I'm really surprised this place is so underwhelming. All the animals are traumatized and almost makes me want to support pita. The county zoo in New Jersey is free and 10 times better. I'm really sorry to say this place is a rip . It's like there are 2,000 animals in the park and 20 are in cages.",2
Zoo,"Usually always enjoy. Lots of construction & limited exhibits now though,  no birds due to bird flu. Pretty pricey for what was available.  Birthday used to get free pass, but no more",2
Museum,What a boring museum. Impressive on the exterior but pretty empty on the inside. I don't think it's worth the cost.,2
Zoo,"Wouldn’t return
Underwhelmed with the entirety of our visit. A majority of the zoo was under construction and many animals enclosures were vacant, even taking the current avian situation into account.",2
Airport,"On a Wednesday , 4.30 am. Only 2 TSA Agents at checkpoint.
Counted 167 people ahead of me.

Not a good representation of this airport",2
Theme Park,Nothing like it used to be and most of the staff are totally clueless!!!,2
AZM,"It may be great for toddlers, but it&#39;s a little unsatisfactory for elementary school students who like Lego.",2
Garden,Prices are high for the quality of the food and the service was not great.,2
Airport,Easy way to get around helpful staff. However the cleaners only clean main area they walked through in terminal E and miss a lot of Trash in the corners and under the seats,2
AZM,"Was very disappointed. Expectations not met. Unhappy animals, singles of social animals, African Painted dogs appeared quite stressed. Habitats undersized, some water pools looked bad/dirty.
A bit pricy for what was provided. With discount, still over $40. Lots of animals off habitat.",2
Aquarium,It was so busy there was a wait line for the wait line. It was the busiest place I’ve ever been and it seriously impacted the enjoyment of the aquarium. It was so packed that we wished we hadn’t bought tickets and could have gotten a refund. I would definitely not go back.,2
Museum,Kind of a waste trip. 90% of animals were not on display due to various reasons. May be we picked a wrong time of the year?,2
Airport,Stay  away from Blue Moon Brew house if not tech savy,2
AZM,"Not impressed. Came a long way to visit a famous zoo, and only saw a few animals. It's hard to find your way to the exhibits.",2
Museum,Nothing new physically works tech wise and then the other exhibits haven’t been changed up in over 2 decades of me going. Nostalgia has unfortunately changed to sadness about this place,2
Aquarium,"It&#39;s a pity that I can&#39;t see Penguin, because it&#39;s being redecorated...",2
AZM,"Rides are alright but the food was terrible, I waited a solid 20 minutes for a fkn chicken San which while they were dancing and eating fries in the kitchen. I was severely disappointed because this is the only time I've had a bad experience but ig it has changed since two years ago",2
Airport,"Took a long time to get security, even with TSA pre-check.",2
Aquarium,"Super busy, the Hasidic community is heavily present,  it's hard to get around with the amount of people that enters",2
Aquarium,Fun and informative but too crowded. The dolphin exhibit was too small and the show was hard to hear as it was too crowded children were screaming and parents kicking the chairs. All other exhibits were nice but some were under construction.,2
Theme Park,Never going back for 98$ tickets UNACCEPTABLE THE RIDES ARE OLD N NOT WORTH IT HOWEVER THE REST OF PIGEON FORGE TENNESSEE WAS AMAZING ACCEPT DOLLY WOOD,2
Aquarium,"Too crowded
Fun and informative but too crowded. The dolphin exhibit was too small and the show was hard to hear as it was too crowded children were screaming and parents kicking the chairs. All other exhibits were nice but some were under construction.",2
Theme Park,Is anyone experiencing trouble buying tickets online I’ve tried several payment methods different days it keeps saying payment declined. I’ve called millions of times and no one seems to care to answer the phone,2
Airport,"Easy check in process; however, the customer service and hospitality is not present once you enter the airport. TSA agents and other airport staff are rude.",2
Attraction,Honestly it is just not worth the money. It's basically got all the rides as knotts or disney but for tiny people only... and the ticket prices are rediculous.  Unless the sight of lego sculptures makes you lose your mind... save your money. The aquarium was nice... and the submarine ride.,2
Aquarium,"After visiting when it first opened, I have only recently visited again. The good memories in the beginning have now changed to a very old and outdated feeling. something is very sad It feels like a lot of investment in facilities is needed.",2
Theme Park,"Rides and stores are awesome. The food choices and pricing is absolutely not family friendly, very disappointed in the ""food festival""",2
AZM,"This is one of my most underrated zoo animals: the red river hog.

#hog #redriverhog #hogsofinstagram #zootampa",2
Zoo,Alot of construction going on. Makes it hard to get around if you are in a wheelchair. Like I was.,2
Airport,Early flight TSA line very slow - even with PRE,2
Aquarium,"Nice place, very clean, nice exhibits. I'm used to the Shed Aquarium in Chicago so in comparison it was small and we were able to go through everything in 2 1/2hrs. Kids were pretty disappointed we were done so quick. Won't go out of our way to come back.",2
Airport,"Bathrooms are always crowded and gross. No where to put down a briefcase. The buses are slow and crowded. I know Sac is a small city, but as we're nauseatingly reminded, California would be the 6th richest country in the world if it was independent. The Capitol of the richest state in the richest country in the world should do way better for it's airport.",2
Theme Park,Not enough ways to get a drink. It's gone downhill since I was last there.,2
Theme Park,After all the hype I expected more. Several rides kept breaking down and we could not go on. If you like shopping it great! Many more places to bug more then to ride. I was disappointed,2
Airport,The food options at this airport are pretty miserable on a Saturday evening connection. I arrived 7:30 and found every food stall either closed or in the process of closing. Most options looked dirty and run down. I’m guessing there’s a major staffing issue that’s causing it? I was a little shocked at how bad it was.,2
Aquarium,"The aquarium was decent. Not really worth the price for a family unless you qualify for the discount. The live shows were amazing, an additional fee should be added so these type of live shows could be longer! Not really a Fan there are other attractions worth seeing.",2
Zoo,Tbh it’s just okay. The zoo is kinda on the smaller side and most of the animals weren’t even there. So pay about $20 a ticket to see half the zoo?? Just doesn’t offer a lot.,2
Theme Park,I am a 100% disabled Veteran and I had to pay full price to enter a State Park. Why?,2
Aquarium,Boy the prices are ridiculous.... just to get food for two adults and 2 kids cost well over $70. 😒,2
Zoo,Most enclosures were closed. Not alot of animals out. Not enjoyable.,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) The rides are small and there is not much to see. (Original) The rides are small and there is not much to see.,2

AZM,"Looks like we&#39;re going to have to finish the work and open it up. The rides stop saying they do safety checks every now and then, and the restaurants are expensive and tasteless... just to take a look.",2
AZM,A little inconvenient for adults because there is not much to do and the time interval of the transportation shuttle bus is too long,2
Airport,"Waiting area no good, lyft area is far",2
Airport,Confusing Staff unfriendlyAnd the fast train to get from one concourse to another oof just prepare yourself mentally,2
Airport,"Horrible layout. To reach terminal from Long Term parking, you go up a ramp then down 1 floor in an elevator. Why not a ramp down and lose the elevator?No coffee past TSA early in AM. Few food options later in day. Chic-Fil-A sure would be a nice option, but no.....banned by city council. How is that even legal?",2
Airport,"OMG I have never seen the airport so dirty, I was scared to sit at my terminal. There are cups, food and trash at the 💺 seats. Where O lord are the cleaning people?. 😩 I waited down at another terminal until boarding.",2
Airport,Always happy to arrive and sad to leave! The press check line was horrible and my flight was delayed,2
Theme Park,It's more for the younger crowd no longer for adults they have done away with most of the good shows and cabins in the train ride .,2
Airport,Getting from car rental drop off to international terminal is by bus and there's no sign of a schedule or help; not sure the frequency of it and it's miserable standing outside in the humid air. Not very well sign posted inside. ClubATL lounge is mediocre at best.,2
AZM,Arrived on a Beautiful Sunday. Lines were extremely long and most of the animals were no where to be scene. Price was slightly higher than average. If you want to see an Amazing Zoo come visit Indianapolis Zoo. We have it ALL including Dolphin Show and most animals are active.,2
AZM,It&#39;s a bit clumsy. It&#39;s worth a visit if you like Lego. It&#39;s too far from the parking lot to the entrance and why is the parking fee expensive?,2
Theme Park,Special flower & food event food over priced and under portion. Not as pictures abd advertised.,2
Aquarium,Ok not really what I expected didn't see no dolphins .,2
Airport,Crowded as usual and easy to get lost in. Not enuf help,2
AZM,Parking fee is too expensive and the distance between the parking lot and the amusement park is inconvenient,2
AZM,"It was ok, several exhibits were closed. But it was very expensive.....",2
Museum,Not sure what the attraction is here but we would not return; the quickest loss of money in Pidgeon Forge.,2
Aquarium,The arcade game machine took extra dollars and someone lost their wallet in the 4d movies with money and gift cards in it and when the people who left the wallet came back for the wallet there was no money or gift cards inside.,2
Attraction,A lot of stuff under construction. Half the food spots are closed and the food is mediocre at best.,2
Airport,"You literally cannot escape the incessant annoying jazz saxophone music, nor the CNN screens. What’s wrong with quiet?",2
Museum,I have never gone to one of these on my 50+ years.  I was so disappointed.   I think Billie Eilish was the only realistic looking one.  Must be a new artist,2
Theme Park,"Definitely not enough staff or food places open & the ones that were open, the food wasn't very good & expensive & had to stand in line over a hour and half. Some rides were great, some were disappointing. So many people, to crowded to enjoy yourself & just to expensive.",2
AZM,Too small... I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it.. Most of the fish on display are ornamental fish. It doesn&#39;t worth... it very small ... most of fish are ornamental fish.,2
Airport,"BUSY, BUSY, BUSY! They need TSA agents BADLY!",2
Theme Park,"5 stars because it's a nice park BUT no stars for the subcontractor that runs it for the state of Georgia. They started charging for everything - the laser show, museum and just to walk around the Crossroads plaza and train area.",2
Aquarium,"Kinda meh....for the price,  it seemed a bit underrated!",2
Theme Park,"Not enough staff.  Had to wait 20 mins in line for a $4.50 bottle of water.  For what they charge, not worth it.",2
Airport,Lines are always long getting through security.,2
Airport,"I am a big fan of Atlanta airport and fly through here a lot. However, the international terminal (F) is horrible. The food selection is very slim. Flying out of here for a morning flight and they have 1 place open for breakfast (aside from Starbucks that has a mile long line) and they were out of half their menu at 7am. Please add some additional options for food.",2
Theme Park,"Staff was so distracted and disrespectful to my family, it was our first family outing with our 15 month old grandson.. I was heartbroken by the decline in employee's that cared about the meaning behind Silver Dollar City....so sad",2
Airport,"Very crowded, on the weekend. Needs more places to eat good foodm",2
Airport,"If you want to travel, understand that Atlanta's airport is at pre-pandemic levels and is very crowded these days. I would say about 2% of the people in the airport are masking. Most restaurants are running at capacity, although I think many are still short staffed.",2
Aquarium,"Looking to it from the other side of the bridge, it didn't look impressive. I went there with some friends and when we found that the ticket was $35 we got shocked and left. It is not worth paying that high price.",2
Airport,"There was a shorter line so we tried this place. Bad Choice. Food was ok but 48.13 for a not so fast food restaurant is absurd. On top of that, it took them forever to serve our food.",2
Attraction,"Went there for a job event, waited for an hour to get seated with one of the recruiters just so they can tell me that don't guarantee a good pay. Online I saw $18.50 but they were mentioning $16.50 and only part time. I value my time and the work I can put in and this place is not it.",2
Airport,"Is this the best Atlanta can do in the busiest airport in the world, one lousy restaurant & bar in this new world class facility multi million $$$$$$$ international concourse terminal.   One poor guy working the very  limited menu & bar in the general area for departure & arrivals Sweet Auburn Market.  Very disappointed.",2
Theme Park,It was decently decorated and we thought it would be more challenging and harder courses but when we started playing there was no obstacles I recommend but could probably find somewhere more fun,2
Museum,"We went there years ago, and I was shocked at how the exhibits were not kept up. Many of the exhibits didn't work correctly or at all.",2
Museum,"No rhyme or reason how people are being allowed in and in what order. Of my group, I was the only one without a city pass, and they waited in line for 20 minutes. I walked right in after buying a ticket online inside. Bathrooms are GROSSLY out of date and need immediate help.",2
Zoo,Very crowded! Unbelievably crowded! Our school bus waited over 30 minutes to park before we could get off.,2
Theme Park,Had to wait 30 minutes for the tram to take us to our parking lot around 4:15 pm. There were trams but the driver parked them and left,2
Museum,Definitely an all day trip!!! So much to see and do!! Lots of exhibits and you can go through an actual space shuttle!I recommend u download the app first and get booked for the 2 tram rides to get them out of the way since they are 45 min each!!!,2
Zoo,Lots of exhibits closed and animals do not like coming out before the afternoon.,2
Museum,"Overpriced. Hannah's mirrors was too short.  For the price, we had seem and done everything within an hour and a half! We had more fun at Behind the Lens",2
AZM,"AQUARIUM
the walk through was very confusing and short.we ended up back at the beginning with no direction where to go.  had to walk through again, but very short",2
Zoo,Allot of construction and closed habitats. Habitats seem small but could be due to improvements. Takes longer than you expect to walk thru the whole zoo.,2
Museum,"Most of the games were out of order, for the price you pay to get in you would think they could afford to fix them.",2
AZM,"The parking fee of 18,000 won is really hard to understand.",2
Airport,"Very crowded today, lots of travelers as normal for a pre holiday Friday. TSA pre was longer than standard check-in.",2
Theme Park,3 rides were shut down for no reason and the food is expensive but stale,2
Zoo,Construction definitely took away from the experience. Very crowded zoo with very small animal enclosures. Just sad.,2
Museum,It was over priced for what it was. It's also stupid that it's open till 8 but opens at like noon. That gives people no time to enjoy it,2
Airport,Staff here looks tired and overworked. TSA set up blows chunks.,2
Zoo,"I usually love the zoo. Took my mother to brag how great the zoo is in Denver.  Was so disappointed- half of the animals not there, construction on exhibits. I felt like we didn't even see animals.  Maybe give it a chance in the fall if they get construction done.",2
Airport,"They need to better mark how to get to the train going away from T concourse from B concourse. Several of us were lost. Also, the displays of the train were pointing the wrong direction.",2
Zoo,"We went today barely any animals out.
Was not worth the $90 we spent to go",2
Theme Park,I think is a bit overpriced and the rides are not really upkept. Lines feel long when they shouldn't really be.,2
Aquarium,"Disappointed
We were a little disappointed with the Aquarium.  We have been to better aquariums that cost less to get in.  We viewed the entire aquarium twice in less than 2 hours without rushing.  It had some nice exhibits but nothing spectacular.",2
Aquarium,It's ok just it's overly crowded can't really enjoy the exhibits for people trying to take selfish and every man for himself position.,2
Zoo,I had not been there in a while. The nocturnal exhibit is almost non-existent. One of the aquarium's is shutdown till 2023. Saw no primates anywhere. I guess if you have a small child it might be fun. But as for an adult that loves zoos it was rather disappointing.,2
Airport,The employees aren't there to help they're just there for a check. Rude and useless. I'll never fly to Atlanta again,2
Theme Park,Only thing is the laser show doesn't last as long as it use to and they charge for the show which they never use to when I was growing up!,2
Aquarium,"Interesting place, but not remotely worth the cost of entry. Even at half the price, this is a hard sell. Additionally, the size of the otter and seal enclosures were concerningly small.",2
Aquarium,"Fun time, but so expensive. Probably spend about 2 hrs in there, with plenty of time to see everything. Wouldn’t consider a membership ever. Even a student pass is 37$.

Additionally, most of the enclosures for the bigger animals are depressing.",2
Aquarium,"I was not impressed, I had some of the same fish in my house aquarium. $ 73 for 2 seniors is pretty expensive for what is there. Easypark people are not nice to deal with if you have a parking violation. If you have a big part of the aquarium (sharks etc) closed you should decrease the price.",2
Aquarium,"It’s fun from a three year olds perspective, but when you the parent paying 150 for an hour, I would Mabe think of something else to do",2
Theme Park,So expensive for the ride tickets. Extremely hot to sit on metal seats in the summer and freezing cold in the weather. Rides don't operate in the rain so choose your days carefully. Food is expensive and doesn't taste as good as the price you pay,2
Zoo,The animals looked tired and the confinement was very small as compared to the animals size. The animals seem to have one problem or another.,2
Airport,Have been using ATL international terminal for long however couldn't help but to leave this comment here. Shortage of luggage carts/trolleys in the international terminal. Also no arrival pickup traffic control. The whole traffic is backed up,2
AZM,Depressing place to be they have all sorts of exotic animals caged up. Only reason for 2 star rating is the craft beer selection. I'm not entirely sure what the draw to this place is or how they are even permitted within city limits.,2
Airport,"As a military veteran I am disappointed with the Airport Authority.  The USO facility is no longer in the main terminal.  So if you have a lay over, you are out of luck!",2
Airport,Hot as hell sad event for 45 minutes nobody came to gate,2
Aquarium,"Very expensive considering it was so crammed and busy it was hard to see all the features there,but once we went round second time near closing it was a lot better.the price on website did not match what it cost in the day the prices were higher",2
Theme Park,Too slow at emptying and filling the rides. Look at LEGOLAND Billund how to do it fast!,2
AZM,Not enough chairs ever but the kids like it. Also think the cabanas are really overpriced.,2
Museum,"This really isn't worth the effort. If you do go download the app first. As soon as you arrive book all the tram tours otherwise they'll be gone within a hour or two. If you are a space geek you'll enjoy this, otherwise it's not really worth the ticket price.",2
Theme Park,I love going to Dollywood but they took away the privilege of the go in after 3 & get the next day free deal. This will be my last year going there ever. Thanks dollywood for taking it away 😑,2
AZM,It's OK not worth to drive 6 hours that's for sure so never going back. I stick to Columbus zoo much much better and plenty to see.,2
Theme Park,The park is over priced and the ride attendents even fully staff seem to just take there time getting guest seated,2
Attraction,"Not so great as compared to their price. Would prefer Disney or universal studio more than Legoland.
Low price to fun ratio.
Don't even buy tickets for sealife. There is nothing much.",2
AZM,"To be honest, it seems like a place run by people who don&#39;t know anything about Lego. The operation, facilities, and price are so different from Legoland in other countries.",2
Theme Park,"It was Imitate from Konoha Gakure
Come better to turkiye and See better things",2
AZM,"It's very hot at the zoo. Most of the animals wasn't out. If they where out, the animals was trying to stay cool because they knew it was hot. I think zoo keepers should kept the animals cool .",2
AZM,"Not really... I went to Korea because it was called Legoland, but I got a separate parking fee for this one.",2
AZM,No school bus friendly.   Park us facing into the sun and not a bathroom in a close distance for those that have walking issues,2
AZM,"Visit with adults. For the price, I don&#39;t think there are many things that adults can enjoy.",2
AZM,"Not very friendly inside the aquarium,  never have chocolate ice cream, and I recieved more info about the animals from the beer lady, sam(I think she said, she was great!) then I did inside the aquarium.",2
Theme Park,Hotel was not as clean as expected. Room floor was damp and dust was along every wall and crack. Also do not get a henna tattoo while there. It barely showed up!!!,2
AZM,There were so many people in spite of the facility that I couldn&#39;t play at all.,2
AZM,Most animals were elsewhere.. mostly empty cages...not worth the price,2
Airport,"After a driver chewed us out and leave, we watched other shuttles not pick us up and leave with no travelers. The attitude here is Level 7 Cranky and Mean.",2
Theme Park,You need to add more locations in the park for breast feeding moms. Or add curtained off stalls in the rooms you do have. I ran into the issue of having to wait forever for the room to open up and having a crying hungry baby.,2
AZM,The fish were cool and the habits were beautiful but the service was sour and slow. It did not flow and lots of people standing in line for no idea why.,2
AZM,It&#39;s for the kids and I won&#39;t go there again.,2
Zoo,"Very little animals. The viewing areas around the cages are badly designed as the areas are not big enough, you'd have to look over people's shoulders. And they charge you a lot of money for everything. I've been to a lot of zoos, and this one is mediocre at best.",2
AZM,There doesn&#39;t seem to be any benches for lower grades to sit on or anything to ride in.,2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) expensive

(Original)
비싸요",2
Theme Park,"Was disappointed, the shops were not what I expected & expensive, but of course everywhere you go prices are high!",2
Airport,"Disappointed half of the restaurants were closed, and pretty much at the supper hours, not cool.",2
Zoo,I feel so bad for the animals they don’t really have enough Shade you can tell that they are very tired of being stuck in there 🙁 they don’t seem happy a little bit of animals,2
Theme Park,Good park overall but honestly the workers need a reality check. Attitudes were not giving at all.,2
AZM,"Don&#39;t go there unless you&#39;re a lego fanatic, except for breathing. If you bring kids who aren&#39;t even interested in Lego, you&#39;ll regret it completely.",2
AZM,It seems to be good for children under the age of 8 to play. Too expensive.. Too tasteless haha. It&#39;s 6 o&#39;clock and I cut it like a knife. a few seconds late,2
AZM,Seemed either too hot for most animals or they didn't have them outside. Seemed half of the exhibits didn't have any animals visible.,2
Theme Park,The map is terrible. You end up wandering around aimlessly. The free water stations are hard to find and mostly out of cups. It's beautiful but needs better layour.,2
Aquarium,Didn't enjoy the experience. Heard great things from everyone I spoke to about the aquarium but I really didn't like how small the tanks and spaces were for the animals.,2
Water park,Prices are stupid plus they charge a child as adult 54.95 not counting tax.,2
Theme Park,"Hard to enjoy something when crowds were so ridiculous. Came during December 2020 when they were restricting crowds due to COVID.
Came again March 2022 and left after a few hours bc it was a sea of people. Two hour long lines for food, no space anywhere. :/",2
Zoo,Need more mister stations. It's so hot. And more seating around restaurants and train area. Be prepared to stand and eat and stand all day really.,2
Airport,"The airport was crowded, small seating areas versus big walking halls",2
Theme Park,There is no consideration for special needs children,2
Theme Park,"The best place in the world to waste your money. High prices, screaming kids.",2
AZM,The wait time is too long because the operation is not good.,2
AZM,"We did not intend to get there but we bought a combined ticket of this museum with the aquarium. Not very recommend there are a lot of unfamiliar characters, very short and feels a bit of a waste of money",2
AZM,"Overcrowded. REALLY overcrowded. Some nice exhibits, but really hard to enjoy with crowd conditions.",2
Airport,Jesus... Staff could use some coaching for sure...i know their jobs are challenging but my goodness...RUDE,2
AZM,I think it's ridiculous that if someone is disabled they are charging $25 for disabled people for rental of scooter like times aren't hard enough with the pandemic and like they don't have a abundance of them! Tsk tsk,2
AZM,Was very disappointed. Lot of the rides were down. The Big Wheel has been down for two years now. I love this place but lately it's been disappointing.,2
Theme Park,"Really not for older people, to many hills and backtracking. Hard to find smoking areas, without seating and Restrooms. Gifts were expensive too.
Some rides not running",2
Airport,"It's 9PM and an airport full of people. Why are all your food venues closed? If I'm paying the same as everyone else to fly thru your place, the least you could do is have food available.",2
Museum,in my opinion only about 5 wax figures had authentic resemblance,2
AZM,The parc isn't exactly finished but price is already here.... A lot of visuals aren't made with the correct police and/or CI isn't respected.,2
Airport,"Overall everything is easy to get from terminal to terminal, however the exchange rate here is horrible. Go anywhere else to exchange money.",2
Aquarium,It wasn’t what I expected. Expected a lot more and it was pretty basic.,2
Museum,Im really upset Angel Lawson doesnt work here any more she was the space center experience when it came to trams,2
Zoo,The Wild Animal Sanctuary is a way better place for the animals.  Not as much shade but lots more animals to see.,2
Attraction,Not good. We went to restaurant and have to pay for parking. Food was not good and service is real bad. Wat a shame but is getting worse every day. My son love LEGO but experience was real bad.,2
Water park,No extra lockers an the rides kept shutting down...,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) It&#39;s expensive. (Original) Expensive and not good,2
Airport,The restaurants close at 7 there are hundreds of people looking for food and only  the pizza place is open.,2
AZM,Many animals not out/seen. Food trucks over priced and not good.,2
Water park,The food needs help here!  I am not looking for 3 star food but who ever is in charge of Culinary for Dollywood should reach out to me for help!,2
Museum,The price had increased dramatically in the last 3 years. A lot of the activities did not work correctly. Not worth the money.,2
Airport,"Why do you allow the restaurants and food courts to close early?  This airport has departures past 1130pm. Good luck after 9pm finding food
Its time to start fining the places that close early.",2
Theme Park,"2 of the rides were not working, splash pool is under construction even though they said open in summer 2022…. Not worth money…. Only couple of rides are there for kids",2
AZM,Took my son to the Cincinnati Zoo last week. Half the animals were not present In their exhibits and the other half were sleeping. It's not the same quality Zoo as I remembered as a child. I recommend the National Zoo in Washington DC way better.,2
Zoo,SAD THAT THE POLOR BEAR HAS PASSED AWAY AND MOST OF THE ANIMALS WERENT OUT WHEN WE WERE THERE,2
Airport,Construction and detours in airport.  Elevator to baggage claim was down again causing people in wheelchairs to have to get off the train a stop early. 😔,2
Airport,Clear lane was understaffed.  Very few masks at the airport or on the plane.   Baggage carousel Dara on the monitors incorrect.,2
Airport,Price high food good can't go wrong wit popeyes,2
AZM,Not enough for the $40.00 . The place was smaller then what the website showed.,2
Museum,Not enough wax figures. It seems like they're more concerned with spacing them out so people can pose. I prefer seeing more of the figures than taking pictures.,2
Garden,Difficult handicap access with myom in a wheelchair.,2
AZM,"Extremely overpriced. The exhibits were cool but admission for 3 people was $100! That’s insane. Also, the workers in charge of the theater were pushy. My autistic daughter did not want to do the movie and the workers kept guilting us for skipping it.",2
Airport,"Every time I've had a layover here it's filthy, garbage cans are overflowing, bathrooms in need of cleaning and stocking.",2
Theme Park,The rides are hidden most are out of order as for weight they need to do more so that even big people can ride the rides,2
Airport,"Heavy with traffic, abit confusing with all the construction",2
Zoo,A bunch of the encounters are missing animals or under construction.,2
AZM,No water animals polar bear couldn't see the penguin its was dark 😢 the clock timer wasn't on,2
AZM,"All food stands, including Dip n Dots were closed(with the exception of one in the center of zoo.) Half of the exhibits were closed or empty. I have been before and it's been great. This time, however, there weren't any zoo keepers holding and animals to pet or interact qith.",2

Airport,"#midnight landing. Every delay possible attempting to circumvent storms but sheesh….. glad to be on the ground.

After being in New England for the week- and mostly inside very cold meeting rooms- walking out of airport into Atlanta heat was a shock. UGH 😩",2
Museum,Needs pay lots and needs wait long for tours or a documentary. Spaceshuttle outside is nice and cost nothing to see.,2
Airport,"Restaurants should close abit late,so as passengers can enjoy meals before traveling",2
Airport,Sacramento doesn't compare to other International airports.,2
Museum,"I don't know who made these wax figures but the greatest majority of them are ridiculous! There were only 4 or 5 that actually looked like the actor. Anyway, it was fun for my 10 year old although I had to tell her most of them. They were that bad!",2
Airport,Needs a lot of improvement. No eateries.,2
Theme Park,We have season passes and the last 2 times we have gone to splash island the concessions have been horrible. We were told today in 103 heat they had no ice.,2
Theme Park,"Ok
This would probably be fun for kids. There are lines on the floor so it made it easy to see where the glass was so you could tell where to go and where not to.",2
Airport,"Beautiful airport. Easy to navigate. Frustrating if you're hungry in the evenings. If you have a layover after 9pm, eat before you come! Every restaurant closes early and the wait for vending machines can take 30 minutes. Why they haven't addressed this problem yet with the high volume of hungry people in their airport is astounding.",2
Zoo,"First time there.

Lots of animals and birds missing. Heavy construction.",2
Theme Park,I will not go back.  They have taken Dolly out of Dollywood.  Not much for older guests except shows and the train.,2
Theme Park,Staff are friendly and courteous. The lines for rides are long but not because there are many people but because poor management. The onboarding process of each ride is horrible and the most time limiting step. They could have reduce the lines at least by half if they do a better job.,2
Airport,Avoid for flights that require transfer from international to domestic terminal. Shuttle system is tremendously backed up. You WILL miss your connecting flight.,2
Zoo,"Starting with parking, there is not enough and its strung out in a lot of little areas. Admission is a little pricey. There is always something under construction.",2
Museum,Not sure if it was worth money as my son could not do most things due to height restrictions.,2
Attraction,"Legoland was great. But the TRUE LET DOWN was the water park. Half of the water park "" Chima"" wasent even open. Although on the website it does not state this at all. Then they won't let you cancel or exchange your tickets but it would be to late once you actually get inside the park.",2
Zoo,"Found it to be a little disappointing to be honest, seems like every other exhibit was under construction or had no animals and the exhibit was closed down. I don't feel that the price we paid was worth it.",2
Theme Park,25 dollars is to much for local people to pay to park the people living in sevier county payes the prices to live in a tourist town how are people living on fixed income going to make it in sevier county,2
Airport,"This seems to be the only airport I’ve repeatedly lost luggage flying out of… Both internationally and domestic. Obviously, make sure to get there early for a flight, but here, consider allowing as much time as you would for security, for the simple task of dropping off checked bags.",2
Theme Park,Atmosphere is fantastic.   Sadly if you are a bigger person you are very limited on any kind of ride.  So far all I could do was the swings.  No coasters. If you love rides and not just walking and shopping this is not the place,2
AZM,"I went there with elementary and high school kids, and they said it was a little boring ;;",2
Airport,It was really busy but some of the staff are rude and was very unhelpful!,2
Aquarium,"So I guess I am going to be a Karen for a moment , but to be honest…. I was not that impressed driving 2 hours to the aquarium for my sons 2nd birthday.
Not sure if it was due to being so crowded ,
I just felt like me and my family did not get to see much .",2
Airport,If i had a choice to go to another airport i would. Nothing is open to eat after 9. They say carrabas and long horn is open til 10 but it is not. Every time i have flown into here mh flight has been delayed,2
Airport,"I went to collect relatives from the airport on flight DL1211. Short term parking was busy but that was acceptable as there are building works taking place in the carpark. What was not acceptable, the 50 minutes waiting for the baggage to come through and no staff member to tell you what the delay was.",2
Airport,Came in early for my flight for southwest and was not allowed to check in and get thru security. Told i could come back at 3am. So no food no spacious seating or charging ports. And the lady was rude AF about it. Shes getting paid to do nothing at the moment. If my flight was now shed have to check me in. Doesnt make sense to pile folx up in a small seating area with no amentoes to provide.,2
Zoo,Didn’t have a lot of animals there. Not the way it use to be. Kinda isn’t cool now.,2
Museum,"Ticket cannot be recognized.
Review just for the ticket. The barcode of reserved ticket cannot be recognized at the entrance. Needed guest service's help.",2
Aquarium,Hasn't changes since I was there 15 years ago. Rude parents let there kids run wild jumping in front of you while you've taken your turn to see the exhibit.,2
Airport,"We need another airport in Atlanta metro, that airport is packed to the limit. Traffic to the airport is horrible. Today we got stuck for 15 mins just to get into the parking lot. Please please please build another airport in North. The traffic needs to split.",2
Aquarium,The aquarium was fine. The person inside the ticketing booth was terrible. She acted like she didn’t want to be there which was probably correct.,2
Theme Park,Not the same dollywood the shows were not top notch as in the past. It will be along time if ever I go back,2
Airport,It’s bad enough that no restaurants are open past 10 but the vending machines are also broken. Come on!!!,2
Theme Park,Parking is getting incredibly expensive. Needs more vegan options.,2
Attraction,"The park is fun, has some interestingatractions but definetly park should extend hours of operation. I think you Dont get what you pay for.",2
Airport,"Harassment in the airport. Then they wanted to take a picture of my DL, I refused! It’s an airport I’ll give you my global entry pass and that’s it.",2
Airport,"It’s a 2 for me. Mostly cuz your not sure what you’ll get? Some of the terminals are super dirty, trash everywhere. Some are perfectly fine. Some employees won’t leave you alone…like when your changing your infant in the family bathroom. Other employees are perfectly fine. Bottom line, Hartfield, invest in a vacuum cleaner.",2
AZM,Very hot day not many of the exotic animals out. Didn't get to see any elepants or tigers.,2
Zoo,Many of the exhibits didn't have any animals. I'm surprised they were open to the public. I recommend to call in advance to hear about what exhibits are closed.,2
Airport,May be largest airport but not absolutely not most efficient.,2
Airport,"It's an average small airport with no whistles or bells. I would expect more for servicing this area, but I  must remember that it is in Connecticut. No money to spend on taxpayer comfort here. Best part is the easy drop off and pick up. Unfortunately that is the only redeeming factor here. I am thankful Laguardia is close enough for me to use.",2
Airport,I am 5 1/2 months pregnant I had a flight to go to Tennessee I got there in plenty of time to be able to board my plane the plane decided to leave 10 minutes early this was not a very good visit there they were very rude and not very accommodating to my situation,2
Airport,"Airport is really messed up now.  Waiting a long time for international park-ride, coming and going.  Landed at E terminal and had to go thru security even though I was exiting the airport ( like the old days).  Signage very poor.  Had long waits on outbound despite tsa pre check status.   Way to mess up a great airport",2
Theme Park,Dollywood was great until a worker tried to grab my cellphone out my pants. please remind your employees not to touch guest or pester them about having their cellphones locked in their pockets when they know it’s a liability and are willing to risk it.,2
AZM,"Staff was friendly, but $80+ for 2 adults seemed too steep for an aquarium that was only worth half as much. For the price they charged, I didn't expect to be asking my wife, ""Was that all?"" when we reached the end at the gift shop.",2
Airport,"All restaurants on the terminal side appear to close by 9, so if you're flying in here and hungry.... Vending machine dinner.

I see no outlets for charging either.

At least it's relatively clean",2
Attraction,Way tooo expensive and each park charges more.. try to explain to a child they can't do it all!!,2
Theme Park,The hotel rooms have no sound insulation.  We can hear footsteps and children playing next door.,2
Airport,They are doing construction around the train and it made getting around very difficult. Had to walk over s mile to get to baggage claim.,2
Airport,Mostly walkways are in repairing and renovation phase Marta Train ticket kiosks don't work with credit card last city train from the airport leaves at 1:00 Am,2
Airport,"Very crowded and the restaurant Sweet Water charged me five bucks for fries and we didn't get any sauces for chicken tenders. I even double checked with her to make sure because container felt light. Highway robbery for prices! So they should at least give you what you ordered. Of course, didn't find out until we were on plane. Should have checked at time of pick up.",2
AZM,I&#39;m annoyed at the parking fee. I don&#39;t think it will come twice.,2
Attraction,"It was ok, but we were disappointed.
The park is hard to navigate, you have to cross the regular park to get to the water park, but they won't let you in with a swim suit on. The hotel pool was closed.",2
Attraction,The souvenir cups did not like Because the drinks spill all over in the backpack,2
Theme Park,"Ordering food is a hassle and it’s expensive. Very limited seating, almost all the seats with shade are taken (pain in the butt when it’s sunny out), and the rides are barely worth it. Overpriced, cramped, and an overall bad experience.",2
Zoo,This zoo is under major construction right now with less than half the animals on site! Please wait until next year to renew your memberships or visit!,2
Airport,Parking garage closed! Plenty of empty spaces as we walked though it. No access to EV charging. Stuck in daily parking with no or very few buses.,2
Airport,What a day of crazy flight issues and then the ATL ground crew walks off and refuses to help us push out after our plane was out of commission for 8 hours. Some dispute between them and the flight crew.,2
Museum,"A few interesting displays, but overall somewhat disappointing. We live less than an hour from the Air Force museum in Dayton, OH and there is a lot more to see there. The AF museum is also free!

Huntsville, AL also has a lot more to see than Houston.",2
Airport,Don't ✈️ Spirit/Frontier. Flight was scheduled for On-Time for 2:30pm😵‍💫😬Delayed until 9pm!,2
Attraction,"Watepark
Unfortunately we came all the way from Seattle, and the water park had a few closures. The wave pool was closed along with the lazy river. They didn’t have enough lifeguards.",2
Airport,They charge $5 for a luggage buggy. What BS.,2
Airport,They charge $5 for a luggage buggy. BS,2
Theme Park,Too packed and was only able to ride 2 rides because of the lines. Was able to ride more rides at Disney World.,2
Aquarium,"It was so crowded it was almost like bumper cars, couldn't move around without someone directly on your heels. Overpriced because of the lack of ability to view and enjoy the exhibits mainly due to how busy it was. Younger children shouldn't be subjected to $45 general admission fee either.",2
AZM,Not our favorite zoo. Signs could be easier to navigate and more descriptive. A couple enclosures smelled horrible.,2
Attraction,A lot of employees had no clue about their Park they didn't know nothing about their Park so just a heads up guys you're dealing with straight empty directories. Lol,2
Airport,The driving directions are somewhat confusing or downright difficult.,2
Aquarium,"Ticket Pricing should be 1/3 if current price..
Visit does not match $47 ticket price..
Somewhat disappointed..
If the said mission of protecting Species and nature is true, then I consider this as donation for the cause",2
Airport,"Mostly, just an airport.  Nothing special or earth shattering.  Then comes terminal B.  Narrow halls, way too crowded, sticky floors, and good luck finding a working charging station.",2
Museum,Visited again after many years. What a great place. So much to do and see. Lots of educational exhibits. Great gift shop. Food cost was really good considering the captive audience. Come for the day. The tram tours fill up so need to book those virtually as soon as you can. It can get crowded.,2
Theme Park,Legoland is suppose to be geared towards children. One of my twins is slightly shorter and could not get on a lot of rides even with an adult which is absurd. The one in FL has a lot more to offer for children that are shorter.,2
Museum,"Not as wheelchair accessible as it could be. Plus,  the wax statues are either really,  really good or really, really bad. There is no in-between and a lot of the hands seem to be kind of translucent,  like they couldn't take the time to do them properly.",2
Airport,"The AC was not in check, it was hot at the airport today 06/26/2022",2
AZM,"Not handicap friendly
Employees are 50/50 on being polite.  Very rushed at opening.  Buildings are not handicapp accessible.  If no opens doors for you, you can get in. Both of us in scooters",2
Zoo,Train was down  Ridiculous prices for concessions. Water was 7 dollars a bottle. 10 for cup of beer.,2
Aquarium,"Disappointed
By the reviews i expected more. a lot smaller than i imagined. The exhibit were too small.
Too crowded which made it hard to get to the elevators, and look at every sea creature
Rude people
Definitely not worth the two hour drive!!",2
Aquarium,Crowded and a lot of exhibits were closed.  Felt more like a playground than an aquarium.  Would never go back.,2
Museum,"Some interesting displays, but really not as informative as I thought this would be.  Fun for kids I'm sure, but I was disappointed.",2
Museum,"Don’t worry about ordering your tickets in advanced online, you will have to wait in the general admission line regardless! Bring a snack and a drink while you wait, too. By no means does that thing move quick.",2
Theme Park,My primary issue with the place is it can be kind of cramped.,2
Aquarium,I must have expected too much It was less than I expected It&#39;s a pity that the beluga is in a very small tank.,2
Theme Park,It's not a good place to go anymore. The employees  act like they don't won't to be there (it shows in the the way they act). The park has changed and not for the better. The animal cages are to small. Will definitely find a new place to spend my money.,2
Theme Park,"Lazy river was dirty on top of the leaves and bugs, floating tubes needed air and they were dirty. Wave pool had floating food. Eating areas should be cleaned periodically. It’s been 10 years since the last time I visited and will not be coming back.",2
Water park,Feel asleep for 3 hours because there's not many rides,2
Attraction,Ok...alot of the water Parker is close ..the lazy river didn't open till 330..the other part of the park open July 1..but not on website,2
Airport,It is a nice airport but every day late to eat closes at  8 pm  d angelos  two roads Phillips   Dunkin McDonald’s papa Gino’s fresh city   When your hungry and can’t get anything to eat it makes u wanna fly from JFK or BOS just cause u Can get food at anytime  🤷🏼‍♂️,2
Theme Park,"This place used to be good, and the rides are still great, but they have become progressively more and more money hungry. I understand needing to make money but at this point it's blantently greed.",2
Theme Park,This place was great fun but there are no veterans discounts I feel we are unappreciated.,2
Theme Park,"VERY crowded, waited over 2 hours for one ride, would've bought timesaver passes but they aren't worth the money, otherwise it wasn't bad",2
Theme Park,"The mountain was really neat, but the other attractions were pretty lame. It was pretty much like a ghost town because most things were closed. I for the attraction pass, but the train was closed and other things because of the weather. No refunds.",2
Attraction,Overpriced. If kids are ages 6-10 and a boy or really likes leggos,2
Theme Park,"Unless you like long lines and limited rides, I would not recommend this park.  Granted there is lots to look at and shop but overall I was very disappointed in this park.  The rides that were open and that we did go on were great fun, but the lines were terrible.",2
Airport,Overflowing garbage most places in E Concourse.,2
Airport,It took 45 minutes to get from the gate to the baggage claim. This airport is a hot dumpster fire. The most enjoyable part is hearing the intercom announcement “the most efficient airport”,2
Aquarium,"Absolutely overcrowded. Not covid safe. We went on a weekday and it was packed and almost no one was wearing masks (June 2022). I don't recommend this for any parents still taking covid precautions. Also all ""experiences"" are an upsell and required additional tickets.",2
Airport,"It's a busy large frustrating airport. I had a 5 hour layover between connecting flights (from international to domestic), I needed the first 2 hours of it. But since I have global entry, I made it through all my checkpoints quickly and easily. It would be nice if the USB and electrical connections worked better for keeping devices charged.",2
Theme Park,Way way over-priced for what you got.  Signage wasn't very good so we got lost a lot.  We tried to download app but reception was bad and it took a long time & we were ready to leave by then.  Staff was very nice,2
Museum,"This place is a sensory nightmare.  My 5 and 6 year olds enjoyed parts of it, but the meltdowns from the overstimulation was not worth the fun moments. A friend recommended it. I wish I had checked reviews to see if it was a good fit for my kids. - one tired, overstimulated Mama",2
Water park,"waited way to long for our food, they weren’t busy, plus the trout was awful.",2
Aquarium,Was kinda disappointed. Also bought 2 coffees and it was old and cold and when I said something the worker told me to put ice in it then it would be ice coffee. Didn't even offer to make fresh and for $7 for 2 small cups that got thrown away was a waste.,2
Theme Park,Not our favorite mini golf mainly due to it being right on the main strip where the heat of so much traffic adds to the very sunny location and brings up the temperature.,2
AZM,"Pretty okay experience, it’s just really over priced. Walked through the whole thing in less than 40 minutes. Definitely not worth the price, but other than that I guess it was okay.",2
AZM,"Small aquarium, not worth the price. What they did have was nice. Save your money, make the drive to ATL and check out the World's Largest Aquarium for cheaper.",2
Water park,"They play the southern charm card but pretty darn rude staff. Bring your own food, if you can.",2
Zoo,There wasn’t really any animals out. Staff in food court were not really friendly.,2
AZM,.. absolutely do not like that they make you take off your prescription glasses to get on every ride no matter if it’s moderate thrill or high thrill. So dumb. I don’t want to ride a ride when I can’t even see it to enjoy,2
Theme Park,Went for the laser light show and fireworks display. Laser show is an outdated disappointment.,2
Airport,Road construction and lane constriction seems to have become a permanent feature of coming to and leaving from the Delta terminal.,2
Aquarium,"A little disorganized. Would be nice if they set it up so you move through the aquarium instead of just going wherever you want. Becomes a bit chaotic. Food prices at the Cafe are ridiculous. Overall not family friendly when it comes to cost.

Great exhibits, lots to see and do during your visit.",2
Aquarium,Great exhibits poor crowd control. We registered a time when purchasing our tickets. Didn't end up mattering as the aquarium was packed and it was wall to wall people.,2
Zoo,Our granddaughters went to enjoy their visit with the animals and nearly all major exhibits were closed or the animals put away. It was very busy and we would have liked to have known potential closures online prior to purchasing tickets.,2
Zoo,"Polar bear and penguin exhibits were closed, which was disappointing. Also, the leopards were MIA. Only 1 elephant as far as we can see.",2
Aquarium,"Granted, it's a holiday weekend,  but most of the staff was short tempered and rude.  If I ever come back to Chicago, which I doubt, I won't be back here, good displays or not",2
Aquarium,The aquarium itself is fantastic.  However the city pass lane is awful.  We have been waiting in line for 33 min for the VIP entrance that the city pass advertises.  Other people who bought just online went through the line with no problem.  Worst check in experience ever,2
Theme Park,"Although this place has really great attractions, there were no parking spaces, and we had already paid. They did not give us a refund. They didn't mention anything about no refunds when we paid. If you want to go, be warned: Refunds are not in their policy. ⭐⭐",2
Museum,Paid $99 for my wife and son.  The figures didn't even look like the celebrities. We were in and out within 30 minutes. Only positive thing was that they did give me my military discount. The wax museum in Los Angeles is so much better.,2
Aquarium,We prebooked a time to go with our kids and I honestly don't see what the point was. It was so busy and congested that we had trouble even getting to the exhibits. The outside areas were better but still over crowded.,2
Aquarium,"I had a lot of expectations from this place but was disappointed

Feels as if the place could have been cleaner and we'll oriented for self guided tours.",2
Airport,"Food service is lacking. It’s either closed, understaffed or menu options are severely curtailed. The train seemed ok but I’ve heard some crazy stories there too. Definitely not a fan.",2
Airport,I have traveled A LOT…but smf takes the longest with baggage claim. Be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 mins or more for your bags. Very inconvenient considering how small the airport is. Dreadful experience each time.,2
Aquarium,"Not much to see, only the price is terribly expensive",2
Airport,The police need to be more diligent about the arrivals pick up because people were blocking several lanes to get in.,2
Aquarium,"Boring!!!
This aquarium is old, not many species and exhibitions, 3D movie is just a cartoon, not creative neither educational purposes. National Aquarium in Baltimore charges the same price but it is much more plentiful of many difference species and exhibition and dolphin show.",2
AZM,"It felt old and the inside was a little hot, so it didn&#39;t feel comfortable.",2
Water park,They need to maintain the slides a little better. Cut my foot and knee open on one of the big slides.,2
AZM,"If you go at this time, the kids are exhausted. They sell drinks, but they don&#39;t put ice in the soda.",2
Aquarium,Seriously overcrowded.   Elevators to parking don't work.  Had to walk 6 flights of stairs in 100 degrees.  Maybe off season is better?,2
AZM,This place is not worth the money over priced for as small as it is took my wife and i less then 30 minutes to walk through it $85,2
Attraction,"My grandson loves it but it is way overpriced, especially the food and they don't take cash, isn't that illegal?????",2
Theme Park,The laser show was good. Getting out of the parking lock there is no guidance no order. It was a MESS a ZOO.  I will NEVER again attend anything here. These people don't care after everyone leaves they just want that money for everything and that's it.,2
Theme Park,It cost enough to get in and you have to pay $25 to park that's what is sad,2
AZM,Price is excesive for what you get. Not very big aquarium.,2
Theme Park,Not worth the money... way way to many people and not worth the time or money.  Not enough to do,2
Airport,Security in this airport is an absolute joke of your are TSA pre or clear.  Hit or miss if they even have a TSA pre line.,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) Not a hit (Original) Not a hit,2
Museum,Been here many times but a lot of exhibits this time were not operating,2
AZM,"It is worth the hardship and fatigue for him because of the expensive ticket and secondly, there are no live shows at all, there is nothing special and new, the corridors are many and annoying, and the boat ride inside has other tickets as well!!! Not fun and boring",2
AZM,Was ok… the main focus was around 1 tank and several mini tanks. Would recommend taking the drive to Springfield and going through the Bass Pro aquarium.,2
Airport,Concourse G was under construction and super hot. Also not a good selection of food there.,2
Airport,The airport layout is a little chaotic and it's a bit more of a chour when your connection flight is in a different terminal. It's as if they want you to miss your next flight and spend money there. No thanks I will try and skip this airport in future travels.,2
Airport,"My only advice would be the back of the plane loads first. It was pure chaos on the flight. Our travel on bags had to go in the way back of the plane as others took over ours.
Better systems need to be put in place.",2
Airport,"One of the most ugliest airports I've ever been to recently.  I remembered the early 2000s, it was one of the nice airports in America.",2
Airport,"The people working inside the airport were great,   however, the airport itself was awful!! One of the most difficult airports to navigate I've ever been in. Especially if you have to get a rental. Don't know how they got the awards they claim they got on the signs posted on the walls.",2
Airport,"Potentially lots of long walks, depending on your gate.",2
Airport,"My ""hometown"" airport used to be on my Top 10 list of great airports. Unfortunately, recent remodeling has turned it into a sterile box that has no character. The architects of this design should be drawn and quartered. Now, you have to take a tram to get to ground transportation, and other off-site services. Total B.S.",2
Airport,Many places closed at 2000 hrs after I landed.  Finding the taxi stand was really a pain in the rear.,2
Airport,The line for customs is very long and slow.,2
Airport,Still here flight delay whether or crew I heard both,2
Airport,not easy to get from arrival gate to next departure gate.  extremely long walk.,2
Airport,"Too freaking big! Too drop off a rental car and get to Terminal 2 involves up and down and up and down and up and down multiple escalators,  a train, more escalators, another train, downstairs check in and upstairs check in.... all before going through security. A 1.25 hour drive turned into a 2.5 hour trip to the gate.  Leave earlier than you think you need to!!!!",2
Airport,Checked in with delta..huge line girlvat desk was not nice at all. I just had to drop my bag she looked at my id..no reason to be rude! Geezs joined clear to get thru security beacuse they wanted me to go to the other end of terminal. Holy long line longest line i ever seen at any airport it was 2pm .. my advise is get thru early,2
Airport,When did they decide that it was acceptable to remove soap from the bathroom?,2
Airport,"Not really much cheese here, gonna be honest that's a rough hit",2
Airport,They moved baggage.  It's inconvenient getting there from the gates.,2
Airport,"Too dang big, too dang spread out. Layovers are a nightmare there each and every time.",2
Airport,I don't understand how all the rental car places in the airport was booked up and not honoring third party contracts leaving tens of people stranded for hours it was a total cluster fuk of an experience I would recommend having a off airport rental car,2
Zoo,"The zoo opens at 10am,the beginning of the heat of the day, all the animals were asleep, or resting where they couldn't be seen. Sucked.",2
AZM,"Pretty short for its price, and a little disappointing with the service I was given",2
Theme Park,It was great for kids. It however is not great for handicap people. Their is nothing for us to do.,2
Theme Park,I picked like the hottest day and after an hour and a half wait they shut the log ride. Very disappointing. Kind of ruined the day.,2
Water park,"Small place with not too many slides. Long wait for the slides. Lazy river not relaxing as there are people playing in the water, kicking, or pushing you. Very congested and not fun at all. You're better off going to Dollywood theme park as it is much bigger and have water rides too.",2
Aquarium,Way to crowded.  We could barley get to the glass to see anything.,2
Theme Park,Very overpriced High school cafeteria food-  $25 for parking…everything is $10 or more.   Parking area has no signs so please take a picture of where you parked otherwise you will spend an hour looking for your car.    V expensive for the value received,2
Aquarium,"Too many people, LARGE strollers or even wagons for kids. Too stressful to enjoy everything.",2
Theme Park,"Not impressed with the food. We ended up eating pizza and pasta that had been out for who knows how long. Crust was hard and almost burnt.  Pasta was dry and not much flavor.  The only other food options we saw were tacos, hot dogs and ice cream.",2
Museum,The space center is a great place but has unfortunately fallen into disrepair.  Took my kids there last weekend and almost every kid friendly simulator was broken and the controls did not respond.  This caused the kids to loose interest quickly.  The space center should be doing better.,2
Airport,"We normally leave from Charlotte Airport but decided to try ATL.  What a big mistake that was.  Over crowded, lines were very long, customer service agents were very frustrated and basically took it out on the customers.  Waited a very long time to receive our bags.  We will stick with Charlotte for now on.",2
Aquarium,"Too crowded. Wasn't able to see everything because of the people, who were very disrespectful.",2
Theme Park,"Too expensive and you have to pay parking when you leave.$27. wow.  Be ready to walk, and wait in line!",2
Airport,"Dog pea next to me, flite DL1782 I paid good money 4 a first class seat & the dog in 3D stank of pea I told the flite attended but she didn't care I told the girl at St Paul desk she just smiled it's like setting in a bran yard.",2
Airport,"Clean and sanitized but when i got off my flight at 12 a.m there was no one to ask for to direct me to the rental cars, i went to the same place 3 times asking for a way to get to there and i then had to take a cab that cost 21 dollars and when i got there there was no one at the car rentals until about 15 minutes later.",2
AZM,"Parking is difficult because there are too many people, especially in summer because it is hot.",2
Aquarium,Not worth the 35 dollar entry fee. Place was dirty and looked as building mantinance was non existent. Dallas location much better.,2
AZM,Most the animals were not out and the splash pad was closed.,2
Theme Park,To expensive...lines to long to do anything..everything is spread out so far that you can't do much in a day. Not worth coming back,2
Museum,It was ok but they rip people off and there isn't much to do for the price of 145 I thought it would have been amazing but it was a rip off my kids really didn't like it they wasn't having fun I would not recommend this place,2
Airport,"Having auxiliary power cut, and once finally restored, aborting takeoff in the middle of the runway due to alarms 🚨 in the cockpit, was not on the itinerary for my flight from Atlanta to New Orleans. I know delta and atlairport are doing everything they can to assure our safety is priority number 1, but goodness it’s hot 🥵 on this plane!",2
Aquarium,The aquarium is nice it just gets overcrowded and even tho they tell you to make reservations they don’t follow the protocol anyways. So what’s the purpose? Anyways right now with COVID they should have workers maintaining the areas that people keep touching with sanitizer. But No.,2
Theme Park,"Too Expensive
I'm not happy that my 2 years old daughter have to pay a full ticket price and she can't enjoy the machines for little kids.",2
Attraction,"If you think it's fun to stand in a barely moving line with your kids watching reserve-n-ride people cut in line and enjoy the ride, then this is the place for you.",2
Museum,I've honestly been to better Aeronautics museums. I was really disappointed I honestly expected more but maybe I was expecting too much,2
Airport,Just be prepared for long lines when traveling international and workers who don't want to be there and are very pushy.,2
AZM,While this is absolutely marvelous zoo I was extremely disappointed in the lack of hand wash stations or general well being of the visitors in today's environment.  I was unable to find a single hand sanitizing station anywhere so had to rely on bathrooms that were never handy.,2
AZM,Final kiosk for Penny insert made us Penny wise as Indianapolis zoo has better Kiosk for inserts,2
Museum,"Was Disappointed
We were disappointed in the experience overall. The sound systems were completely outdated and made it impossible to hear anything in the shows/ or tours. This is a problem if you are taking the white tour which is a narrated tour.",2
Theme Park,Dollywood is a nice place but needs to be more handicap accessible. We had 3 people with scooters and one in a wheelchair and they couldn't get into a lot of places.,2
Theme Park,Can’t handle the hotel common areas with rooms occupied. Not sure if all booked but even so. Reservation for breakfast is useless. 15 min on-line to get in and another 15 to get food (which is not decent quality given the volume),2
Airport,"Crowded and understaffed and extremely slow long wait at the car rental location, the bus to the car rental area is crammed and the driver has no speaker and shouts but nobody can hear, it's dirty here ghetto area.  Inside near the plane terminal it gets better.",2
Airport,"It's massive, busy, and the folks that work there don't want to be there. I avoid it whenever possible.",2
Aquarium,"2 stars, aquarium is great, half of the stuff underground stinks of b.o. almost no ac. Front entrance rushes you to get tickets, and if you end up getting the wrong one you're screwed.",2
Museum,"Went on a Thursday, and was told they weren't really that busy... if this ""isn't that busy"", I don't want to know what busy looks like. Everything costs extra, food prices are ridiculous so eat before you arrive.",2
Garden,"Hotel front desk needs to learn hospitality
The hotel front desk needs to learn hospitality and they also need to learn about service recovery. Virginia at the front desk was very rude. The bellhops/greeters were very nice and the restaurant workers were very nice.",2
Museum,Not exactly the experience I was looking for. Very oriented towards children. Seemed like a cashgrab. All the employees looked miserable. This place definitely cuts corners.,2
AZM,"The guy taking our money for tickets was incredibly unpleasant. There was confusion about our kids’ ages and he got offended when I told him that he rang us up incorrectly. The aquarium is beautiful and was incredibly interesting, but not nearly worth the cost of an adult ticket.",2
Airport,We had a stop over in Atlanta from Guatemala for 4hrs. Once we left plane every restaurant was closed except for McDonald's which had an insane  lineup. Turns out a different terminal had restaurants open but would require a train to get to.,2
AZM,"Didn’t like the layout of the zoo. Most animals were inside. Food lines were crazy long. Compared to other zoos like Pittsburgh , Milwuakee zoo I give it a 5 out of 10",2
AZM,"Overpriced tickets, and overall not much of an experience. Better for kids. But a trip with 4 adults was kinda boring. Most animals were in hiding or sleeping. Not much interaction between guests and animals. Overcrowded and quite a small zoo. Also a long line to get tickets.",2
Aquarium,"if you like chucky cheese with sharks, then this is for you. It has amazing potential but a lack of flow and for some reason claw machine games defeat the beauty of the marine life. It should focus less of pushing for side streams for revenue and more on the experience",2
Airport,Need more restaurants open until 9,2
Airport,"Everything closes at 10pm, nowhere to sit before security checkpoint.",2
Theme Park,Dollywood is very expensive for a limited amount of rides. This means all of the rides have very long lines.,2
Aquarium,"Buy tickets by the app make a little harder to get into the museum.
Tickets are very spensive .",2
Airport,"Desperately needs a cleaning. There was a dead roach on the handrail leaving customs and trash all over terminal D.
Hostess at Chicken and Beer was unnecessarily rude.",2
Zoo,Hardly any animals to see.  Lots of the exhibits were over grown with plants.  Been to smaller and bigger zoos in other cities with much better animal exhibits.,2
Theme Park,First time here last week.. All I can say is here you pay $25 to park to be left walking back to your car when lack of organization with them trams. Food is expensive! $35 for 2 fries and a drink. I won't go back that's for sure,2
Water park,We went last year and had a great time but this year the best rides were not in operation the price for food was outrageous and alot of stuff seemed run down the floats were stained there were so many people crammed in the wave pool that it probably wasn't safe,2
AZM,"The park is run down
This park is run down. We took our granddaughter and her friend. They had fun but let me say it was hard to find something to drink that wasn't $ 4 for water. Alot of places weren't open and I will never go back. Try a different place but this was a bad pick for us.",2
Zoo,"It was just alright  haven't been here for a few years was disappointing they added more shops and food places but it seemed like there were not very many animals
of course everything  was  very over priced",2
Museum,"Some of the events they had, myself and many others didn't reach certain requirements. It's too complicated and not worth the money to try. Cool looking on the outside but not worth the money.",2
Zoo,"The walk today was nice, but not so worth visiting.  Not a whole of animals",2
Theme Park,Still a racist theme no matter how they try to whitewash it.,2
AZM,"We would've liked this to be a bit longer of an experience, but nonetheless it was neat to walk thru.",2
Aquarium,This is such a small aquarium compared to the ones I normally go to (Tampa & Chattanooga) and it was more expensive as well. I was disappointed.,2
Aquarium,It was ok this aquarium is not that interesting they don’t have much animals at all but it was cool to the sharks and the alligators but I suggest that you don’t spend our money on this place if not that to see and be exciting to be there unless you have like very young elementary kids,2
Theme Park,I just checked in and I'm giving it a three so far. This is the second time I have stayed here and requested a low floor room and been told that I would have one but yet got here and did not.  I never have this problem whenever I make this request at any other place I stay.,2
Airport,"Inevitably when I have a layover in this airport I have mere minutes to sprint from one terminal to the next using the ""Plane Train"" This airport is huge and the Signage isn't the greatest.  Not a fan",2
Attraction,"One of the rides just has a longer time waiting in the line than how much is supposed to be
The line in Splash Battle took more than 45 minutes. I’ve noticed some of the boats in that ride were empty.",2
Museum,"Interesting, but over priced! Plus the extras aren't kid friendly. Don't recommend it you have small kids.",2
Theme Park,"Bring your own food.  Not bad enough food options are limited, service is painfully slow.  Lot of workers standing doing nothing with food being delivered at at snails pace",2
AZM,Half their pop stations were out of ice and some of the rides were shut down.,2
AZM,Not impressed. Most of the exhibits didn't seem to have any animals.  Place is overrated.,2
Airport,It was an ok experience for the most part although the TSA agents were rude as hell. I would give the airport 4 stars if TSA gets their act together,2
Theme Park,Not a good experience.  Hot days have no shade. Staff seems friendly. They DO NOT take vip points but will give you 5% off if you show you lego vip number. Only a year set up and staff is still learning so makes things confusing for everyone when you have a question.,2
Airport,Why would anyone recommend this place???,2
Airport,My complaint is there is never an available go car to get handicaps to the  gates and or the drivers don't want to take you.🤷🏾‍♀️,2
Theme Park,Some dude stole my phone and the view at the top was mid,2
AZM,Kinda lame for the price of $55 for an adult and a child. Honestly felt like it should of been $10 per person. The bloom room was really the only cool part sadly. The ride made my daughter(9) motion sick.,2
Airport,PLEASE GET RID OF THE STUPID CONES!!! EVERYONE HATES THEM!!!!!,2
Theme Park,Couldn't watch the show I waited in line for. They ran out of seats.,2
AZM,Last machine for memento was too small here Indianapolis zoo is better,2
Museum,Many things not working and the wait was awful big waste of $35,2
AZM,"The only two things we came to see, sloth and flamingos, we're out that day. Really disappointed .",2
AZM,Was disappointed the last time we were there.  The food was made wrong 3 times for lunch.  The zoo just wasn't as clean as it was in previous years.,2
Airport,"Wouldn't liked to explore the airport and area but unfortunately the terrible airline service from Delta didn't let that happen.  I had a connecting flight that was cancelled pretty late so by 11pm ALL RESTAURANTS WERE CLOSED N NOTHING TO EAT OR DRINK. 😳 Thank goodness the staff provided snacks n water but it was a VERY LONG NIGHT. airport was ok, DELTA NOT!",2
Garden,"Needs a lot of improvements in customer service
Staff needs to be trained in customer service . The activities should be informed at check in and signs should be included in the resort as well . The bathrooms in the pool area need major improvement and maintenance.",2
Museum,The place is so big without having someone take you around you just start losing interest. The tram ride you could not heard the loud speaker. It was very loud and distorted.,2
Theme Park,Stone Mountain was a lot more appealing prior to Covid. I've done some research and it seems that all entry points to the train shops and other attractions are no longer available. Membership and daily passes are the only option.,2
Museum,"It was a little pricey for having broken down exhibits. I don't know if we just caught them on a bad day, but a lot of the stuff there wasn't working. We still had a decent time and we are 24/25 years old. There was a line, but we probably only waited about 30 minutes to get in.",2
Attraction,Legoland is starting to fall apart. Rides went down and obvious repairs of Lego structures are needed.  My two girls are 9 & 11 and not thrill seekers. They thought Legoland was too young for them. The rides are designed for kids 5-6 year olds.,2
AZM,"Quite a few animals not in,.  in closure/ construction.    prices vary on internet and actual price chili sucked",2
Museum,Music was loud and all the lines. Were long to do things.,2
Airport,I hate to give low ratings. But. Atlanta employees are rude and unfriendly. Try to ask for assistance you’ll see what I mean. Come on Atlanta!!!! Put a smile 😊 on your face. You don’t like your work???! Leave let someone else work with smile.,2
AZM,The animals were hiding because it was to hot and we went on a ride and the animals were to far to see it was pretty boring,2
Airport,"Being a small airport, you’d expect a low-stress travel experience. Enter SMF - horrendously poor signage from the freeway all the way to the gate, if you’re lucky enough to find it. Good luck choosing between the three food options, two of which apparently close at 2:30pm.",2
Museum,Fun exhibit to visit but not worth the price if you are overweight (anything over 200). Extremely rude employee running tyne gravity bike will fat shame you and tell you infront of the entire crowd that you should lose weight before returning.,2
Museum,"Not as cool as I remember it from 5 years ago.  A lot of the stuff is in disrepair, kinda lame.",2
Theme Park,My wife and I were not that impressed in fact we were somewhat shocked. I guess we are both spoiled by the hospitality and experience that we get at another person family entertainment property that we have season passes to and expected more from this park.,2
Garden,"Very average resort
We booked this resort as part of a group for a reunion. Unfortunately some of the bedding and the carpet were stained. Also the mattress was hard and uncomfortable. It was a one-off experience that we are not likely to repeat.",2
Aquarium,"Not taking Covid precautions. Not well laid out or managed for the amount of visitors. Some nice tanks, animals, and exhibits, but many are disappointing with lots of artificial hardscape, etc.",2
Theme Park,"The laser show was composed of advertisements for GA attractions, and music from 1983, and definitely not catered to all backgrounds. Can't believe they charge for it.",2
Airport,The most confusing airport that I have ever been in. The airport could really use some work stations near the gate such that individuals that are flying for work could optimize their time spent at their facility.,2
Zoo,Sad zoo. Exhibits looked as tired as the animals. Only upside was the caring zoo keeper that took the time to talk to us about the Okapi.,2
Airport,The temperature inside the building in the summer is worse than any other - people need to get blankets because they freezing.,2
Aquarium,It&#39;s bad The most disappointing among the aquariums... It&#39;s good that the aquarium is bigger... The parking lot at the aquarium doesn&#39;t even have a parking space Worst I don&#39;t want to visit again...,2
Water park,The water park was absolutely slammed. It was 95 degrees and many of the rides were 45 minute waits or worse. Food was very expensive (worse than Dollywood). I think with less people it would be more enjoyable.,2
Airport,Tuesday I would give the airport more than 2 stars but the parking and parking ramps are amiss there's lots of construction going on . If you're going to park I suggest  Adding some time.,2
Airport,The airport was very busy most resurant where closed during my connecting flight.so I was starting but Wendy's was open but very slow because it was the only resurant open.,2
Theme Park,"I have been to SDC for many years.  I will tell you if something doesn't change it will not be worth the travel or ticket purchase.  rides down,  food area closed, games for kids closed. Employees not able to understand English or speak it.
Also it needs to return to family atmosphere.",2
Airport,Long walk between connecting flight. Almost didn't make the second flight ..,2
Museum,"I paid full price, and went I went to take one of the tours, they said there weren’t any more tours for the day. They should have told me this when I was buying the tickets. It was a rip-off.",2
Airport,"We arrived at our gate 90 min prior to boarding to find not one seat available. There are no designated handicap seats. Myself & my husband, who has a bad hip, had to stand at the gate D1A waiting area for 2.5 hrs, as our flight was delayed. It was also very warm.",2
Museum,"Only a handful of the celebrities were pretty spot on,but most of them needed an update really bad and I personally went to see Marilyn Monroe and Lady Gaga and was very very disappointed when there was no lady gaga I walked through the museum twice just to make sure I didn't somehow miss her 😞",2
Aquarium,Always great experience just wish they had more opportunities for shows we came at 3pm and all the shows were sold out(full) It was my son who was visiting for the summer 1st time and he couldn't fully enjoy his time because of no shows available.,2
Theme Park,I havent been here in 10yrs and it with the high cost of parking and admissions. Which is more than a ticket to williamsburg. It will be 10years or more before i return. I wasnt impressed with the changes.,2
AZM,Used be a family place now its just a cash cow . My God the cost of EVERYTHING EVEN WATER,2
AZM,If not included with sealife ticket its not worth to visit. Not much to see.,2
Airport,PLEASE do something about the train inside the airport. The doors only stay open for 5 seconds and I watched the door close on two people. Everyone is pushing past each other. It’s chaos. Please just make the doors stay open for longer.,2
Museum,"We took our grandson and he liked what he saw there, but we were all disappointed that most all the interactive displays did not work.  Can't teach a child if the displays don't work.",2
Airport,"Flight from Anchorage arrived at 9pm. Next flight boards at 5am.

No restaurants or bars open past 9pm.

Makes for a long night.",2
Airport,No trains were running at 3:30 am and had to walk to baggage claim. Also all ladies restrooms were closed.,2
Garden,"Resort rooms need updating
the bike paths were maintained and great-the rooms felt like 1070-and the hostess at the piedmont and the guy at the front desk need lessons on how to do whatever you can to make it better for the customer",2
Theme Park,Had rides closed and not running more than  one line on rides which made it very slow,2
Aquarium,"Fairly disappointed from the moment we entered the building. Most of the staff seemed disinterested and disengaged which has influence in the experience. The space was incredibly dirty and not well maintained. Limited variety of exhibits. The tickets were affordable, but evidently for a reason.",2
Theme Park,"Overpriced at $70 for a day compared to $40 for a competing park in Dallas, StL or KC. Parking is free but you may get transported on a closed bus, not a tram so if anyone has COVID, you might get it too. The park is clean and the people are friendly but it is not a good value for the dollar",2
Theme Park,It need some renovation and cleaner swimming areas.  It is expensive to enter this park yet I found the black moldy stain in the wave pool was not appealing.,2
Attraction,They need to move the lines faster. Little children are waiting! Especially safari car ride. Many employees standing around with a line of empty cars.,2
Attraction,"Disappointed with the service
We had some trouble finding the rides we want, but the thing that most disappointed us was the Unlimited Drinks Collection cups. We couldn’t find place to refill it. When we did find a place, it was running out of drinks. That really disappointed us.",2
Theme Park,Park has changed so much and the employees could care less,2
Theme Park,At age 60 not recommended. Was extremely hot and overpriced,2
Museum,"Not a great place to bring children under 10. I wish there were more hands on exhibits. Waiting for the tram with nothing to keep us occupied was a letdown. It was neat as a one time visit, but I have no plans to return.",2
Theme Park,Pretty poor operation today. There were way too many people in the park to only be running 1 train on most roller coasters. Multiple hour+ long waits and lines just creeping along. App doesn’t show wait times accurately. A much poorer experience than the last time we came a few years ago.,2
Theme Park,It's a mess now. Best things of the park is taken out. All the changes was a mistake and especially the parking. Need to regroup and rethink . This is not Disney land.,2
Airport,"Probably one of the worst airports in the US. Tsa pre closes at 9, restaurants and shops are closed even earlier and most people are just grumpy. Probably because they can’t go to the bar and get a drink because it’s closed or completely packed. At least it has a good cell lot for the delta pick ups.",2
AZM,"As aquarium goes this one is so so. Some fun ideas and will probably ravish kids, but clearly not world class (in spite of the high ticket price). Always feel a bit sad especially for the mammals stuck in there.",2
Museum,Went for a make a wish trip and was just shuffled thru like everyone else.we told the front desk why we was there and they said great have a nice day.no compassion for the child.this was apart of her make a wish and it was not very memorable,2
Theme Park,Not for handicap people have to walk to far to get a wheelchair or a scooter then after you give it up your scooter you have to walk again too far,2
Theme Park,"Hot
It was HOT, 95 degree’s hot. They charged 40$ for two refillable cups of Water!!  They charged 10$ for two small bottles of water!",2
Aquarium,"(Translated by Google) expensive

(Original)
비싸요",2
Theme Park,I used to love going here now it's overcrowded and overpriced with higher prices coming next year. Be ready for long lines on everything.,2
Theme Park,The app is total garbage. Kept telling us rides were closed and they weren't and vice versa. Wait times were wrong and the park is not easy to navigate. There were a lot of rides that were shut down.,2
Aquarium,"I was able to see the sights well, but I thought that the photo service you took at the entrance would print out or send it to you via cell phone, but you have to pay for everything. It&#39;s all money. The staff are friendly. That&#39;s good.",2
Airport,The so call train was not working and due to my husband disability the walking was WAY TOO MUCH the atmosphere was amazing thu,2
Airport,"I got things stolen from my bag which i was and still  very angry about. Other than that it’s not a bad airport, but stealing? Really? My bag pockets were open with clothes switched around to places i never put them. My socks are also missing. That’s not fair or okay in anyway. Thanks for your services.",2
Airport,Gate changed twice to a completely different terminal and delayed twice.,2
Aquarium,I was expecting a bit more for the price. Nothing really stood out compared to other aquariums I've been too.,2
Theme Park,"Legoland won't last long
I found the price of admission to be high for the experience! I found most of the staff to be grumpy and not accommodating! We did  about every ride and experience in about 4 hrs and felt almost $300 for admission was ridiculous. The non cash thing was annoying as well.",2
Museum,too crowded and tram rides has serious organization problem.,2
Museum,"Not all cracked out to be. Most of the wax figures were not really that good it's maybe worth $15 a person but not $32. The photo was with Kevin Hart I'm 5""10 and he is 5""2 with a big head.",2
Museum,Half the experiments didn't work and one of our family got pretty messed up on the 3D bicycle ride. Pop machine stole $5.00 from me. We were with 3 kids and they had a blast. I think they should give out wristbands so adults not participating don't have to pay $30 plus Dollars.,2
Zoo,"Underwhelming
We love zoos and have been to several. The Denver Zoo was quite a disappointment. A lot of empty exhibits. Over grown greenery that could use some love. The staff wasn’t fun and enthusiastic.",2
AZM,Some of the rides I like best were closed very disappointing,2
Airport,"TSA line too long.  Crowded. Wait line for ticket counter was extremely long, lack of personnel.   Made it flight with just 5 minutes to spare because of the lack of personnel on duty.",2
Attraction,Fun place to take the kids not to expensive but workers are rude and take forever to but people on rides,2
Airport,"Sure it looks nice but they do not as they say, care about the customers. Our luggage was sent to a different location which would take a whole day to get to, and when we politley asked questions to the staff on how to get it back, they showed us nothing but attitude. Because of this I'm currently missing out on my vacation, I have no clothes, no food, and nothing to do. I'm disgusted",2
Zoo,Most of the animals weren't even out. We paid $20 a ticket to go walk around and look at foliage pretty much. The shade was nice. The gift shop was lacking. The lion & tiger reserve in Ouray is way better.,2
Zoo,I don't think it's really worth it. Tickets are expensive compared to value. Most of the animals are hidden and train was closed.,2
Theme Park,Rides are limited. Mostly kids rides with long line. Each ride was an hour wait.  Kids did not like it and don't want to go back. So think before going.,2
Theme Park,"Wait times
Reduce the waiting times on the rides, and open up more water rides. The wait times for the rides were all over 45 minutes long and at time the rides shut down due to maintenance. Also at over 80$ per tickets, I would expect ALOT MORE.",2
AZM,Lot's of the Animal's was to far that u couldn't c them good. And the train ride was a waste of money. All u saw was trees and bushes no animals.,2
Airport,Showed up 2 hours before my international flight and couldn't even get through the baggage check before missing my flight,2
Airport,"(Translated by Google) The airport looks sad, of course because of Covid 19.

Airport,"I made an appointment on the phone to get Global Entry reapplied to our New Passports, the lady never entered it into the system, and she set it up for 7:30 am and they don't even open until 8 !! Luckily the person working made a call and confirmed that I called and did what he had to do..... Thank you !!",2
Airport,Busy for a tiny airport. Needs a remodel. Almost no place to plug in electronics via USB or even 120v this is 2021 people smdh,2
Airport,All the restaurants are still closed,2
Airport,Only airport they close TSA boarding at times why when we pay,2
Airport,"I was only there to pick up someone, and there were cars parked in the handicapped spots with no plates and no one telling them to move. I needed one of those spots as the person I was picking up is handicapped.",2
Airport,its under construction parking lot is not enough. there is no public restrooms in parking garage,2
Airport,"(Translated by Google) The Jetblue line urgently needs to improve the quality of customer service. Both at the airport and by phone calls.

(Original)
La línea Jetblue tiene que mejorar con urgencia la calidad en servicio al cliente. Tanto en el aereopuerto como por llamadas telefónicas.",2
Airport,Went through the hassle of getting Covid tested 1-3 days before flight. Since they said I wouldn’t be able to board without presenting a negative result. They didn’t even check anyone’s test results. Came earlier to airport anticipating another line to be in upon arrival. They also don’t check temperatures like they days they do.,2
Airport,"Not enough signs to show you where you are going
Maybe they want u to do mistake and enter the Garage so they will charge u 3.75$ for one minute",2
Airport,"The ladies room shd be checked more often. The one near gate 4 smells like urine and its only 9/10am. It shd be checked and cleaned every hour. Parking is way too expensive, in my opinion and based on my experience. Be  encouraged to park elsewhere and shuttle to the airport to save money.",2
Airport,Very disappointed.  My wife lugged was missing in Tampa airport. Never got on board. It is missing.  She flew Spirit Airlines,2
Airport,"Not Well lit and a bit confusing with exits,(exit 39 & 41 go off  to the right and exit 40 for the airport continues straight??)then road ends",2
Airport,I AM NOT PLEASED BECAUSE MY RING AND FITBIT WAS TAKEN FROM MY BAG AT THE CHECK-IN LINE GOING TO ATLANTA I WANT TO KNOW WHY AND I WANT THEM BACK LAST NIGHT I WAS TOLD TO REPORT IT NOW THAT I AM HOME THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE HAPPENING AT B I AIRP TO ME ITS A DISGRACE,2
Airport,Going through security the personnel were very rude.,2
Airport,I usually live Bradley just this time flight was canceled.,2
Airport,"I cannot think of a reason why ANY airport these days or any airline should receive anything higher than two stars!! Really, I should only give one. I'm tired of political correctness run amok and your stupid mask rules which do nothing for anybody.",2
Airport,Actually it was not busy at all yesterday lines were out the door almost. It's an airport not the greatest nowhere to wait for arrivals  so you are forced to pay for parking of which there is never enough.  I've seen lots cleaner airports in my life....,2
Airport,Had to wait forever for someone from American Airlines to check in bags.,2
Airport,Waited almost 1 hour for luggage pickup!! Otherwise busy and had pick up at curb.,2
Airport,Give your self a little more time to get through security the line was very long at 5:30am on a Tuesday morning.,2
Airport,Kind of sad. Only McDonald's was open to get something to eat for flights leaving after 8pm.,2
Airport,A pain to park but otherwise not bad,2
Airport,Very delayed & canceled repedialy. AA cancelled & finally canceled requiring until the next morning. We were responsible for our night being spending @ a nearby hotel that ripped us. I've never had an experience like this before.,2
Airport,No good restaurants Dunkin’ always short of supplies no Starbucks in any he Terminals Restrooms poorly designed,2
Airport,Fast TSA. Lame hours for restaurants.,2
Airport,It was alright besides having to drive around it 10 times to wait for the person I was picking up,2
Airport,Not bad cool little low key airport much better than flying out of Boston.,2
Airport,Not great. Had girl hurt me.i am 72 years old,2
Airport,My first time flying.. thought the airport food and snaps were very high,2
Airport,Parking rates for the garage keep going up. Expensive for long term parking.,2
Airport,Got here early so I could finish some work on my laptop. WiFi was not working. Waste of my time.,2
Airport,Went in to do some business. The parking here is a joke . They expect you to park a mile away in lot 5b . Umm no,2
Airport,"Jet Blue employees are pretty rude and not very helpful at the counter.  Once in the plane, the employees have a whole different demeanor.  It is not my fist bad experience with the counter employees.  They are lacking training in people skills and then some. #Jetblue take notes.",2
Airport,"Rental car signs point you too an empty building. Employees were surprised I followed their new signs vice surprised their new signs point to the new, unused building. The current rental car wait is in the smoking area. I guess masks are good for one thing.",2
Airport,"All the staff is extremely rude, they don't know how to communicate with people and have bad customer service. It's like they all assume you know what's going on, I'm a first time flyer and I was expecting a better representation of the airport.",2
Airport,Blandly is a crowded small airport. Getting through security is dreadfully slow at any point of the day or night. My family and I got in line one hour and 22 minutes before our plane started boarding and we barely made it.,2
Airport,"Very long lines at 5 am. Planes for the most part, late taking off",2
Airport,"Early flights are very hectic and busy.  I was here on a Wednesday and the line was almost completely filling the lobby area.

There is minimal guidance as to where to line up.

If at all possible enroll in TSA Pre-Check. It can significantly cut your waiting time to get through screening/security.",2
Airport,Great airport BUT HORRIBLE BAGGAGE HANDLING. Waited over an hour last night for my bag. Sad to say they've been terrible at baggage claim forever.,2
Airport,"So busy, and unorganized dropping off, or picking up. Plus pressure from State Police, and TSA security to keep it moving. Always a mad house 24 hours a day. I was only dropping off and picking up a friend, so this is only based on that, not the service when you are inside the actual airport.",2
Airport,Only one bar open on a Monday? Lame...,2
Airport,An inconvenient airport to fly from American Airlines.  The bag checking system is archaic compared to other contemporary airports and TSA has been actively combative in our experience.  I would recommend avoiding and choosing another airport if possible.,2
Airport,It was a bit confusing driving in,2
Theme Park,Over priced. If I go again it will be cause my kids want to go. But as for me I'd save my money. The bubble show was amazing. Lunch was good at Aunt Granny's. Cinnamon bread was good. But I wouldn't pay $100 just to enjoy those again. Enjoyed the scenery.,2
Theme Park,Very underwhelming compared to the other Legoland parks.,2
AZM,It OK to me they took out to mine animals & to mine rides it's not a zoo any more,2
Airport,"I shouldn’t have to pack lightly just because Hartsfield Jackson airport doesn’t care to accommodate people who are using Rideshare. There is a 1 mile walk from Baggage Claim to Rideshare and it’s outside of the airport in 90 degree weather, so just a heads up",2
Airport,"It's a dump if an airport and Allegiant makes it even worse. The plan left without us and Allegiant said, ""you missed the plane so no refund.""",2
Attraction,"Bogus birthday package at Legoland hotel
Breakfast at hotel was 1 hour wait. We had to miss early access. Birthday package at hotel very disappointing. They didn’t even hang up the birthday banner like the description says it would. Over price package don’t get it.",2
Airport,"Between delays, cancellations and variants, #airtravel has been stressful this summer! But I got these #traveltips for you cuz these mickeyfickeys ain’t stopping me (or you!) 🥳✈️🌍 

#traveltuesday #travelblogger #travelwriter",2
Water park,"Lines sucked, ""time saver"" passes made it worse. Waited in line for 2 hours for 1 slide and almost 2 hours for food. All the lines were way too long. More food options need to be available and they shouldn't sell Time Saver passes for this park.",2
Airport,The restaurants in the food court close too early at 10 PM. What are we supposed to do if our flight with a layover comes in right before 10 or just after it? That is very frustrating.,2
Airport,"Got stuck here for over 24hrs due to delayed flights. It's very big, sprawling.",2
Airport,To many flashing lights at 4 am and so many reflecting cones make the drive in for a drop off a hazard!,2
Airport,"This airport was to small, it had only little stops.",2
Airport,The bathroom was cleaner before.,2
Water park,They kept stoping the ride due to thunder I know it’s not there fault but it’s still disappointing. L,2
Theme Park,The lines are on par with Disney land and got the dinner pass premium and only a little amount of food you can choose from in the whole park 🙄,2
Museum,120 bucks  for 4….20 minutes . The outside of the building is cooler than inside. Won’t return,2
Airport,"The airport does not have enough shuttles to get you from the Rental Car area to the B terminal. After you return your rental car, make sure to add another 30 minutes to give yourself enough time.",2
Aquarium,Not what it use to be. No large sharks. Penguin area smelled really bad. $188.00 for 4 adults 2 children to get in and the food Court was soooo expensive !!!!!,2
Museum,"No inversion tunnel on the way out, so now I’m stuck in the upside down",2
AZM,Foreigners are twice as expensive as locals and smaller than expected,2
AZM,Nice quality but my favorite Starwars  character not here,2
Attraction,"Disappointed
Lines were not efficient and a huge disappointment. We waited in line for 40 minutes each time only to go on a lame 30 second ride. We thought Legoland would live up to the Lego name.",2
Museum,Got there at 3 and didn't finish the tour and the old lady was grouchy at the gift shop .although enjoyed seeing the first two floors. As a disable veteran the escalator was not working and elevator s is was told was not working properly.,2
AZM,"we Love the staff, but they decided to stop the tram because of covid 19.but the San Diego zoo still does, so if covid is such a issueWhy have shows, and the petting zoo? When it's 100 + outside it's hard to walk to see all the areas.So I recommend rethinking this zoo in the summer.",2
Airport,"They are under going construction, but many of the dining areas are closed.  I just ate the worst $11.99 Italian sub from Cibo so that's likely impacting my rating.  They have free wifi so that's positive.",2
Zoo,"Sad, denver has more money than this. Thought Colorado cared about wildlife...",2
AZM,Not in the heat at noon because it's too hot for the animals and the visitors as well,2
AZM,"Much smaller than expected. Nice, new building but not worth the price!",2
Water park,Very small water park at an over price expense. I'd save the trip and visit a bigger one for the same price.,2
Aquarium,"Not worth it, maybe for kids only. But for adults, you'd only see some tiny fish",2
Aquarium,"Is incredible that in 2022 we are still witnessing places such a stingray touch: more than 30 people with their hands on the water trying to touch them. Also the pinguins are in really bad conditions, fiches in small tanks and dolphins swimming in water that wasn’t exactly transparent.",2
Airport,I had to spend the night due to being over booked,2
Airport,What? No air conditioning in the south?   Like walking through an armpit in here.,2
Museum,Not really impressed with most of the personalities.,2
Airport,"A lil weird.  Fire alarm blazing, NOBODY moves.  After like 20 minutes a few (2) cops show up and say it's a false alarm.  Weeeeird",2
Museum,"Kinda dirty, half items broken , some cool things . Wouldn't ever reccomend but it was an experience",2
Airport,Way too busy for me. One of the few airports that I do not like.,2
Airport,Very busy.  Early in the morning not to many options for food.  Long lines at the few options.,2
Theme Park,"The lawn in front of the rock was fenced, and ,in order to access you need to pay an extra entrance ticket (for the laser fireworks,  even if the fireworks start after sunset and you visit at noon),",2
Museum,"Tram system sucks, wanted to do mission control tour but apparently it “sells out” even before 1pm. Was given rocket park ticket instead and tram didn’t show up at time we were told, stood outside waiting for 20+ extra minutes. At least there were fans to try and cool us down.",2
Airport,This place needs a university that specializes in broom training,2
Theme Park,No exhaust fan in bathroom.  Rooms were old and dated for the money they charge. Over priced.,2
Attraction,"Long lines, rides broke many time while waiting in line.  Not sure why you need to make day reservation if park is jammed…",2
Museum,"It was okay but a good bit of the attractions were broken and it was pretty dead in there because they were closing in an 90 mins. Best for kids, probably not smart just going as an adult which was my bad but I expected something for like 70 bucks or so for two people.",2
AZM,"Day pass  Admission is expensive for what they offer. You have to pay lots of extras like parking, soft drinks and 15 dollars for smallest locker possible. Lots of rides where out of order and in general it wasnt worth it.",2
Museum,It was so disheartening that we paid the entry fee for 3 and walked the entire site with possibly 5-10% of animals AT MOST. Would have been nice to be told at the window so we could determine if we wanted to stay....45 minute drive...disappointed is the least I can say.,2
Airport,"Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta is not my favorite airport especially during a delay. Outside of security the homeless wander around and sleep inside by baggage claim, the train smells like urine and the homeless aimlessly wander on train. Inside the terminals is okay but there is not enough seating at the gates.
With that all being said I would rather be stuck at Atlanta airport then Dallas Airport.",2
Airport,It lacked shops in the terminal,2
AZM,"It just don't seem like they have very many animals,some animals looked very depressed I noticed ,I wasn't to happy about the zoo trip..",2
Aquarium,"(Translated by Google) It's old.

오래됐어요",2
Water park,"This was my family's first time here. Lots of concessions were closed, many rides were closed, the bathrooms were disgusting. Thankfully it was overcast because I can't imagine how people escape the sun without paying $$$ for a covered area. Really overpriced and not worth it. Not coming back.",2
Attraction,"Legoland could be amazing but its tired, faded and past its prime. Needs a major (!) refresh. Wildly overpriced from admission to food. You’d be better off spending a couple of hundred bucks on actual Legos for yourself or your kids than on admission.",2
Airport,"Beast of an airport, tight connections are stressful. Restaurants are always out of food or overcrowded, 8pm and most were closed or very limited on what was left.  Being the busiest airport in the world it is also the least efficiently ran. If I didn’t have to connect Delta here I would avoid it completely.",2
Airport,"If they are going to make a connection, be very careful! They may lose it; the migration process and then pass the security review again can take more than two hours",2
Airport,Very busy evening at ATL. Food vendors were running out of product.,2
Theme Park,I was just checking this place out don't like price not good rates for what they offer no rooms with cooking abilities. They don't even have adjoining rooms. I wouldn't book a stay with them.,2
Aquarium,Most oeople were not wearibg masks and no one was reinforcing it,2
Airport,"I was disappointed with this trip through Atlanta.   I was leaving from Ter. D, which didn't have any where near enough food merchants for the number of people.   I couldn't even get a coffee.  Ridulous.",2
Zoo,The animals didn't want to come out lol it was too hot,2
Airport,It should be all hands on deck in the morning especially in General Boarding.,2
Aquarium,Pricey and underwhelming experience. Very few interesting exhibits. Only plus point was it was indoors.,2
Aquarium,We really wanted to enjoy our experience but it was over the top crowded to thoroughly enjoy.  More staff needs to enforce no tapping on glass since parents of small children dont have the decency for marine life to do so.   Some of the enclosures seemed incredibly small.,2
Airport,Parking directions posted are unclear,2
AZM,Don't blink or u will  miss it.. this is literally the smallest aquarium iv ever seen.. It looks huge on the outside but we were done it 20 minutes..,2
Zoo,Amazing zoo that makes you feel like you are so close to the animals! Can't wait for Australia exhibit to open!,2
Aquarium,"Couldn't even go😢😢. The parking was not well marked. Even though a Friday didn't see any valet parking.  Everywhere nearby was $70 (apparently some concert nearby)!😡😡😡
Only get to the area like once a decade and was hoping to show my sons but not for that price.",2
Aquarium,Not as good as I remember from when I was a kid...  Small and very expensive,2
Airport,"Frequency of the combined rental car shuttle is atrocious.   Are they trying to waste even more time for customers who already have to put up with delays?

Unacceptable.  Had to wait over an hour with so many people waiting in long lines",2
Theme Park,Ticket prices and parking are way out of control. You have a nice park but with your prices you are making it not worth the trip.,2
Theme Park,Invest in fans for the ride lines. I’d rather waste my money on Disney.,2
Theme Park,I get tourist attractions are pricey but this one is over priced way to high for a very short experience. Go in and fry and get lost but you’ll still find the exit far to fast. Save your money and ride the go carts.,2
Theme Park,Very costly of little extra charges..... parking fee and 70.00 for use of electric wheelchair!!!!!,2
Airport,The way the employees treat people from the restaurants to the check in clerks at the flight boarding doors are beyond what I have ever seen. Poor customer service,2
Aquarium,It used to be really good when they had whales tanks are dirty water is cloudy,2
Museum,Decent place. Many of the rides did not work. I was somewhat disappointed over all.,2

Aquarium,No value for money .. High price .. Should not be worth more than $20.0 Adult and $15.0 Child,2

Zoo,Many animals were either not available or just dodnt want to mone outside. Its was a bad day.,2
Airport,"Very disorganized, chaotic and unprofessional. They sent tons of baggage to the wrong place. None of the staff seem to care or even know what's going. The whole place is a shambles. Terrible customer service, deplorable operations and subpar business ethics. For this to be the busiest airport there should be some type of standard. You would expect this is a third world country.",2
Museum,"I found the visit mediocre at best.
If you removed specific costumes and the plaques, you would not recognize most of the statues/people. A lot of the people were off from the real people.
I wouldnt pay the price to go in it again, i felt the value just isnt there.",2

Theme Park,If the rides weren't shut down it was an hour wait or longer.  Only one set a cars on the track. When a month b4 the place was busy but short wait time bc the had 2 sets on the roller coasters.  Ridiculous  we left only riding 2 rides.,2
Theme Park,"Lego land
Insanely expensive value not worth it. Long lines and lines moved very very slow. Also 30 bucks to park car as well. I think there is much better value at other parks.",2
Airport,"I am at E8 deoarture not have one place to buy a soda or chocolates,  they are closed before 9.30pm. God!!!!!!",2
Theme Park,It needs more areas to cool down at. Or at least have more fans around the park. One of the poor workers Greg wasbjust covered in sweat!,2
Theme Park,"My 4 and 6 year old had fun on the rides. BUT the heat and no shade, and no water park area, and crazy long lines didn't help. For the 60$ per person we spent, we needed shade, water areas, less waiting times, longer rides....",2
AZM,A third of the animals was off displays in the process the remodeling never told that I would never went very disappointed in it,2
Theme Park,"Very expensive, no water park wet attractions.
Not enough shade, not suitable for hot days",2

AZM,It's not like it was  when I was there couple years ago,2
Water park,"not worth the money for what they had to offer
we got in early and didnt have long lines but for what it costs i expected more rides then what they had. The lazy river was great but not much else as far as I concerned. Definitely check out the other water parks compared to what they have",2
AZM,I was actually really disappointed in this zoo. Hardly any animals in their way to small habitats and over priced. Columbus zoo was way better in my opinion.,2
Theme Park,"Wait times are ridiculous.
There is only 1 staff member assigned to each ride.
Most of those staff members are older and move slow.
Everything is cashless.
Everything is wayyyy overpriced.
Definitely not worth a revisit.
Don't get me started on the express line.
Clean and well kept park, though.",2
Airport,Flat out false advertising for non stop flights via jet blue Bradley International Airport - BDL to Las Vegas.... either fix your website or offer flights you advertise... just saying,2

Aquarium,Too crowed can never see anything.. nothing new there....,2
Airport,The directions to get there were hard to follow on Google maps. There are  different roads at different levels without clear signage. Inside everything went very well.,2
Zoo,A bit over priced as the Cheyenne Mtn Zoo is better,2
AZM,"Not to happy
Disappointed that allot was being redone so allot was closed. The hills are a bit ruff and not much eating inside. The sensory package was great and so was the sensory room. And several sensory bathrooms were closed which disappointing .",2
Zoo,I have always loved Hogle Zoo but there obviously is no attention being paid to the glass in every enclose. It's really bad and should be a priority.,2
Theme Park,"Very expensive for a place where the staff takes their sweet time to make people get on and off. Takes for ever to get on a ride and short time for the rides. Parks closes to early, make you do a 2 day visit because of limited time",2

Museum,"Lot of Money for So Little
I didn't expect to see expect to see rappers who are also criminals in this museum.  I expected real actors & actresses who have made history like Elvis & Marilyn Monroe.  Very disappointed & hate that I wasted almost $70 on visiting this museum.",2

Airport,Nice facility but it's really bad for departures. Too less nonstop international flights departing from it,2
Aquarium,Whale sharks and balugas we're really the only thing that excited me. The sheer crowdedness during a summer weekend was a nightmare.,2
Airport,There really needs to be an overhaul to Terminal A. The carpet there through checkpoint screening is down right disgusting. Come on already and loosen the purse strings and tile the area. Instead of subpar food there as well get more food vendors. There are no good options for food if you fly out of Terminal A.,2
Theme Park,Lines were super long and it was hot but it was very disabled people  friendly,2
Airport,"First, if you travel during the day, nice airport. If you leave late, everything closes down and apparently they turn the air up or off. Our plane was delayed, very hot terminal and nothing open to get a snack or drink. City might be big, but airport runs like a small town airport.",2
Theme Park,ATP why even go?! They're charging for EVERYTHING!!!! Attraction passes don't include half the attractions AND you have to pay to sit on the grass to watch the laser show. I've lived in Atlanta my entire life and never has Stone Mountain cost almost $200 for a family of 4 for 1 day. Ridiculous.,2
Airport,Very crowded. They need special lines for parents with small children and seniors over 70.,2
Airport,"My luggage was lost on the way to the airport which isn’t their fault however when I called their baggage area I waited on hold forever, got hung up on, called back, and the airport refused to check if my bag had arrived.

The airport employees seemed nice otherwise. And I did like the airport. But I wish they could have helped me. I really needed those bags.",2
Garden,"This place deserves 5 stars. However, calling and trying to reach a human being on the phone is nonexistent!

For PaT- it was very disorganized, we were just sent on our own. Had no idea there was going too be food. 
Sorry wish it was better!",2
Museum,Kinda scammy. 1/3 of attractions cost extra money. A couple more don't work. Also here's a scavenger hunt for just $4.00 more. More of a place for kids 10+. 👎🤨👎,2

Food trucks take 15 minutes to get food, then turned people away because they couldn’t handle the 3 orders they had.",2

Aquarium,"I was very excited to see this place but it didn’t have much to offer, could look at everything in about 30 min and it was 35 dollar per person. Also it stunk of sewage the entire time.",2
Theme Park,crazy kids screaming waking us all up at 5-6 am and the bed sheets were very dirty with many stains on them overall pretty bad experience,2
Aquarium,Was OK —but never go on holiday weekend …what’s the point of timed tickets…it was a madhouse of people and they had sign saying closing at 5 pm,2
AZM,Overpriced for how short it is. 80 bucks for about a 20 min walk thru.,2
Aquarium,"Save your money! For a family of 3 with a barely 2 year old it was a little over 100 dollars. My son did enjoy it, but an hour later we were exiting the gift shop. Not worth the money, or the stress on a young family.",2
Theme Park,Too long in line for everything for what you have to pay to get in and the cost of the food is high.,2
Aquarium,Very crowded so it is hard to really enjoy the experience and read all the information.  Maybe if you go during the weekday it would be more enjoyable .,2

Theme Park,"Rides and attractions are ok, but somewhat underwhelming, especially for the price. Surprising number of things is broken and attractions closed for such a new resort. Food is atrocious and costs arm and a leg, a daytime robbery. Parking is a rip off.",2
Airport,Why does the terminal smell like an old trailer this airport is in need of an upgrade to match the growth that's happening in the city,2
Theme Park,Rides was 2 min each by time u sat down it was over . Definitely for kids 8 and under . Wear comfortable shoes lots of walking.  Different restaurants basic options,2

Zoo,"Awesome experience but the original lion drinking fountain was SO DIRTY! Its usually a joy to drink out of it, ever since I was a kid. It was very VERY SAD to see!! Almost looked like the poor lion statue was crying. Please clean it!!! (And please NEVER replace it)",2
Airport,Waited outside with numerous other passengers in 111 degree heat for an hour for a shuttle to our economy lot. Many empty buses came by empty until my husband stepped in front on a bus and complained to the driver.. he radioed in and about 15 min later we were picked up… ridiculous,2
Zoo,"Don’t get the train tickets. It’s so sleazy to me when places like this charge people money, including my ONE YEAR OLD baby, when half of it was showing us a completely empty enclosure that they were working on. Don’t take money from people for nothing. That’s unethical.",2
Theme Park,"This used to be an amazing place to visit.  Also, some of the craft demonstrations were not happening.  Now, it's just a bunch of lines.  Such a disappointing day!",2
Museum,"I'm not sure if I'm biased because I'm from New York and we have a very big Wax Museum. But, it was ok. The wax figures are outdated. A lot of the celebrities do not look like that anymore. They should reconsider the placement of the figures. I enjoyed the mirror room.",2
Airport,Concourse F Delta club 30 minute wait just to get in.  Only half the restaurants open.,2
Museum,"Don't get your hopes up. However, you know what you're going to see when you visit and wax museum. Many of the figures were not very life like. Some of them were even unrecognizable, such as Elvis Presley. The biggest complaint with this place is it is extremely overpriced.",2
Airport,"Very busy, staff and people aren't the friendliest, especially for the south. If you fly frontier here, get there EARLY. Bags took a long time, very big airport. I'm biased because I live in Phoenix and our airport is fast and empty most times, but wow ATL was busy.",2
Museum,"Not recommended
I have never been to a wax museum before so have nothing to compare it to. Most of the figures were not life like, they were, well, waxy looking. I would not visit again.",2
Airport,Terminal train had black mold on the air vents,2
Airport,"Not a good collection of cars, especially for the President Circle. After taking my Driver license, The lady at check out said that I don't have a reservation.

How can she look for someone else when i handed my DL.",2
Theme Park,I love Dolly but there was absolutely no shade there. The small areas that did have shade people hoarded them.,2
Theme Park,They still need more seating for their outdoor dining and more shade options,2
Museum,"Most of the 'stars' looked slightly cross-eyed and just a bit wrong. Close to who they were supposed to be, but not close enough. Definitely not worth the price of admission.",2
Museum,"Personally not happy about management, app to check-in virtual queue was almost crashed multiple times. Even though we got slot in virtual queue still we need to stand in queue.

Need lot of improvement. Specially they should have guide or any informative app.

Should have more food options.",2

The staff were not nice and were not professional. They definitely need some training to learn how should they treat visitors",2

Theme Park,"The sky ride down did not have a motivated employee the food at barbeque was cold and  no soda  drinks . no coffee at the snack bar at top. The employees need a motivation speech, The few set a bad example for all.",2

Aquarium,Very unorganized needs to create maps for exhibits and extremely crowded. Many exhibits were closed.,2

Museum,Kinda disappointed with this place! Space X Falcon 9 and Independence plaza were decent but no wow moment inside the main facility,2
Attraction,Had high hopes for legal land but unfortunately it's super run down. Some rides weren't even open. And the water park is only open on the weekends even if it's a federal holiday weekend. Hopefully now that legoland owns the park again it will get better,2

Airport,"Seems like every time I use my hometown airport here lately something goes wrong.  NOT the world's most efficient airport by any stretch.  Today it was severely slow busesses to go back to the international terminal.  Come on guys, really??",2
Airport,Checkin was quick. Hotel is a bit rustic and you will experience as soon as you use the lift. Lift was taking so much time to close and open. They don't offer any water bottles and you have to purchase. It costed me $5 to buy 1 liter of water. That's ridiculous. Room was okay but the ceiling paint was coming off.

1 area in the whole park really?
Just a shame",2
Museum,"Only a few exhibits directly reachable, two tram tours that are very fast booked, so most likely you will only get one. Some movies to kill time waiting for a tram.",2
Garden,"The discovery center cafe staff is rude as ever, no ice for drinks and food is expensive which is fine but have ice",2
Zoo,Unfortunately our timing must have been really bad because 75% of the animal enclosures were completely empty.  The temperature was about 70 degrees.,2
Theme Park,Disappointed. Not much entertainment like past years. Half the decorations. We said this summer with so many shops going out and less entertainment we won't be renewing our season passes.,2
Theme Park,"I can say I have been there I guess. Really no desire to go back. A bit pricey for ones that don't ride the rides, and don't fall into the senior discount. However we went during October fest and decorations were pretty, but to pay 179.00 to walk around and see decorations not so much.",2
Airport,You need to do better for these handicap people to get in and out of their cars in a safe manner. If you see a car that's parked illegally are you taking forever to tow it out of this ladies way it's uncalled for and you better,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) There are too many people (Original),2
Aquarium,Drove 7 hours and too say we were disappointed is an understatement. It's like a huge congested over priced mall. It was definitely not worth the money. The only part we did enjoy was the dolphin show.,2
Garden,Pay admission to get inside so you can get overpriced food truck eats then no where to sit to eat.,2
Attraction,"It's expensive there. The food stalls are not open on fri except for workers so that makes no sense. Sat was pack and not all the food stall was open. Then some of the rides that was running on fri. is closed on Sat., the busiest day.",2
Theme Park,very few games  It's not worth the time wasted waiting in line!  very few things to do,2
AZM,I went on a week day. It was very clean. All of the rides were down except for 1. Most of the small eating stands were closed.  Thankfully we bought the City Pass or I would have been even more disappointed! Definately not like it was 3 years ago when I visited.,2
Airport,"Current construction is causing already heaving backup during check in, and going through TSA.  For ATL to be the world's busiet airport, they only have ONE check TSA security point for all flights (even international). I was insane.",2

Zoo,The bathrooms are horrible. They need to be cleaned way more then they are. Even after the bathroom was cleaned it still smelled really bad.,2
Theme Park,"Honestly not that great. Tje rides are good, but some of employees were rude. Also to note that they aren't open a significant amount of time during the day and wait times for every rude was close to an hour or more. My family and i was there from 10am to 4pm and rode 5 rides.",2
Theme Park,The view was absolutely gorgeous from the hotel I stayed....too expensive for Motel 6 accommodations.,2
Theme Park,The glowing harvest festival lights were great but you can see nicer at botanical gardens. The prices are outrageous considering it’s over and hour wait to ride a ride. Definitely felt ripped off for what we spent on the tickets and parking. Nice to be able to say we’ve been but won’t return.,2
Theme Park,"Not good
We were there all day and were only able to ride 4 rides. It is next to impossible to find your way around this park even with the map they provide. Their signage wasn’t helpful either.",2
Garden,When staying at Callaway Gardens make sure facilities are going to be open. Today Tuesday October 11 the Putt Putt is closed and there is no trolley to the Corn Maze.,2

Better for smaller/younger children.",2
AZM,"It was closed for renewing when I went, wasn't update on the site or on Google",2
Attraction,"Searching for Food
The main issue my family and I came across was that most of the food stands and restaurants were closed. It was very annoying having to walk halfway around the park to find food. Not sure if it’s because we went on a Tuesday or not?",2

Theme Park,Directions were not clear as to where to the Wildwood Grove for the after  5 show at night,2

Airport,"So if you want to make it on time for your flight.....I would be at this airport 4 hrs before your flight...TSA lines are so long. Just FYI. I missed my original flight, and connecting flight to Hawaii. So a 11hr trip became a 18 hr trip 🙄",2

Airport,Most of the staff is pretty rude; legit we flew from lax to RIC and had a layover here and ughhhh,2
Airport,Long lines and a lot of walking,2
Airport,They no longer have the Hibiscus tea. Dissatisfied with that decision.,2
Theme Park,"The place is nice, good attractions for kids BUT the staff let their friends/relatives skip lines for the rides which it’s not right and not fair at all!!!!!!! It should be unacceptable!!!",2
Attraction,Just go to Disneyland. The Reserve and Ride isn't as good as Genie+ and more than 3x as expensive. The rides and attractions are an underwhelmed. Some nice photo ops but not enough of a reason to go.,2
Museum,"It was kind of cool at first, but really wasn't worth the price of admission.  Some of the figures were really impressive, but some didn't look like who they were supposed to be.

Save your money and just watch a movie.",2
Theme Park,My only real disappointment was trolley passengers had to walk a long long way.   Very hard for guests with mobility issues.,2
Museum,"It was just mostly boring.  If you think you'll be interested in the records, just buy the book, skip the noise, and the overpriced, packaged experience.",2

Theme Park,Tiny tiny mirror maze. Took is less than 5 minutes walking taking our time. Waste of money.,2

Museum,"Not worth the money
I was not impressed with it. Kind of like a large arcade. Nothing really great there. It gets over crowded and since there is not a lot to do you wait in line for quite awhile to do anything. Also it is very expensive for what you get.",2
Theme Park,It was run down and uncomfortable.  The staff are polite but clearly exhausted and a bit rough around the edges.,2
Theme Park,They’ve already put a bad taste in my mouth. With most hotels if prices decrease they will honor the new prices. At legoland Hotel you have to pay a high percentage for a protection plan to be eligible. Booking early can cost you big money!,2
Theme Park,Was really happy with the bungalow. Was not happy when I found 2 baby ticks within a 30 minute period in 2 separate floating legos in the pool. The attitude of the life guard was unacceptable! Make sure you check your children!,2
Theme Park,Overall the experience is just bizarre you check in at the front gate at security in your car?? Staff is kind of unfriendly. And really need to work on their diversity training.,2
Theme Park,"Wait 2 hour for dinner, then they serve the adult food n 30 minute later brought the children.",2
Theme Park,The resort is cute and that’s the only positive I can offer. It’s WAY over-priced. The food at Sandy’s is horrible. EVERYTHING closes at 9pm. Such a huge disappointment.,2
Theme Park,"Housekeeping did not make up room for our two night stay at ~$500/night. Ants in room.  Front desk does not answer the phone.  Overall setup is cute, but this is not a well run hotel setup.",2

Theme Park,"Bad experience with service, rooms were just ok, the green areas look pretty abandoned,breakfast is not buffet, very bad service at the restaurant, we waited for our food more than 40 minutes, we were the only table, you can find something better and cheaper. Not recommended at all",2
Theme Park,If your kids are not at least 38 inches tall they can't really do any of the fun water activities.The problem is THEY DONT TELL YOU THAT BEFORE YOUR PURCHASE,2
Theme Park,"Sometimes the attractions close without any explanation, after queuing they say no more, the food and drink refill places are the same",2
Theme Park,"The rides aren't bad for little ones but the arcade is a total rip off. It's basically skewed so you always lose. Sad, disappointed, empty handed little kids 😢 😔 😞",2
Theme Park,Fun for little kids but not worth the price.  Should be prorated based on the number of hours open.,2
Theme Park,Closed at 5 pm come on !!! Is summer ☀️🔥 the hot weather is beginning,2
Theme Park,water park great. but the hotel not good  terribly parking you have to walk 3 blocks to get back to the hotel.never going back after paid 400 a night.,2
Theme Park,The water park is definitely not worth the money. The Legoland water park should be separate.,2

Routing is very very confusing
It is easy to walk out of security",2
Airport,Huge. Lots of transportation. Not easy to navigate.,2
AZM,Decided to go during first part of fall. And most animals were not in outdoor habitats. They were redoing half the indoor ones so waste of money,2
Airport,TSA pre check was jammed with people. One female responsible for checking ID & boarding passes was loud and inappropriate in giving instructions to remove mask for verification.,2
Airport,So slow. Only thing good was the art work. They need to learn how to organize the security better,2
Airport,"Potentially nice airport but security lines are terrible, even for TSA pre and Clear. Signage is confusing and inadequate.",2
Airport,"Has alot of vistors i believe top in the country if not one of the top in the world. But the way its kept up omg. Thrashy not classy. I just got off at terminal d at gate d3 and the thrash bins were loaded up spillong all over the floor, and just sticky. Disgusting. Looks like its been 4 hours or more since thrash has been emptied.",2
Theme Park,The Silver Dollar City app isn't very friendly. It was hard to find different places. Ended up getting over 7000 steps and was only there a few hours.,2

AZM,"Some sad looking animals and extremly long lines without the items on their menus once you reach the stand, closed exhibits and not worth the time and money unless you don't eat and drink and love seeing animals in misery.",2
Aquarium,"General admission is not worth the price.
I have been to other aquariums in Chicago, Vegas, Florida. I felt Georgia aquarium is overpriced.",2
Museum,"1st time
it was okay! We went through to see what it was all about. Nothing special really unless your into reading everything. Gift shop was much more expensive then others in the area that had the same items.",2
Theme Park,Their prices are crazy expensive the workers are so rude no days it is nothing like when I visited as kid it is so sad actually cause I really use to enjoy going here and want to go now to make memories with my kids but the prices are just outrageous for a family of 5 then to be treated so rudely,2
Theme Park,"Needs improvement
Definitely overpriced if you just attend the Pumkin Festival,  Train Show was terrible. Laser show was 15 min and the parade was a joke. Definitely for kids 4 and under. Pirate ship was cool.",2
Airport,"Arrived today Oct 22, 2022, 10pm…They allowed cars to park at pick up areas so it gets congested. then the West Econony shuttle takes 30 minutes to arrive many times… what kind of service is this?",2

Zoo,Completely cramped for the animals. Construction and miss marked pathways. It was a complete disaster even compared to 10 years ago. Stop worrying about revenue and open up some space for those animals.,2
Theme Park,Signs say you can walk back to the E lot in 25 minutes but there is a large stretch with no pedestrian walkway,2

Theme Park,"Security was rude to me, unfortunately. The park itself was lovely.",2
Airport,Why do all flights in the southeast seemingly stop in Atlanta.  If I wanted to fly from Santa's Workshop to Never Never Land I'd have to stop in Atlanta,2
Airport,"TSA Pre-check only has one entry point, and it is near entrance S1. Poorly signed route made us walk the length of the airport to get there from the check-in desk for Spirit airlines. By the time we got to the checkpoint we were exhausted. After that, it was straightforward to get to our gate, if still a long walk simply because the airport is so big.",2
Theme Park,It was over capacity and you could not do anything without running into people,2
Airport,Dunkin coffee is terrible.  I wish this airport had a Starbucks.,2
Airport,Hotel shuttle busses drop off to far from security.  There should be security checkpoint at term G.  3 of the five walkways were not working.  This “G” terminal looks like an afterthought. Very inconvenient.   $100 for a non NFL sweatshirt!!  Lines for coffee at every location were 20 people deep.  Clean bathroom.  Atlanta does better with a tram.,2
Zoo,It's ok nothing really fun just good for a walk and to tire your kids out 😆,2
Airport,So busy and they seem to make you race to your connecting flight. I'd rather avoid this airport if possible,2
Airport,"It's crowded. Everyone is rushing around in a hurry. Food is very expensive ($40 for two sandwiches, small bag of chips, and medium coke). There is no seating in or outside the restaurants; you have to eat in the terminal seats with no tables.",2
Museum,Not impressed much. It is too expensive for what you get to see.,2

Airport,"The dirtiest large airport I've ever seen

Airport,"Typical airport, busy and congested",2
Garden,Went for the pumpkin patch it was $20 a person and I don't think it was cost-effective considering what was available to do while you were there especially on a family on a fixed income.,2

Aquarium,Free the Homies! I hate seeing animals locked up. With that said… Shark Tank with turtles exhibit was dope.,2

Theme Park,All of the food vendors and restaurants closed at 7pm although the park was open until 10 pm.,2

Airport,"Huge, loud, crowded, takes far too long to make a connection here and once you are able to board the aircraft you can almost guarantee you will be waiting at least twenty-plus minutes to depart because of the sheer volume of traffic here.

Theme Park,Didn't meet all the hype that we have been hearing.,2
Aquarium,They started on this species recovery program.. translate that to we got rid of 50% of the aquarium and fish.  Then on top of that they want $28 to get in.  It was worth it in the past but not now,2

Airport,"Look, there were cancellations all over the place yesterday. And I understand that a situation like that will cause an influx of ppl. However, you would think the airlines and airport in general would prepare for that.

Shops were closing go during the day",2
Airport,Seriously… way too many PAs. Like I’m trying to read a friggin book. No one CARES,2
Theme Park,Some rides were out of order. Food was not so great. They shouldnt charge to adults so much.,2
Theme Park,"fun for kids 8yo and younger,went beginning of November and there was no snack shops open, and only 1 place to eat.  the line was 100 yards long.  not worth the admission price",2
Airport,Not great selection of food. Outlets are rare.,2
Theme Park,"Semi disappointed
good for 8yo amd younger, every place was closed to eat except the pizza and pasta restaurant with a 2 hour wait.  went beginning of November.  Not worth the admission price",2
AZM,"It’s a pretty cool aquarium but for the price… honestly, go spend your money somewhere else. Adult ticket is $33 and it’s totally geared to younger youth. Not all the fish in the aquariums are identified, it’s super dark in a few areas and disorienting.",2
Airport,busy busy busy. waited 1 hour in line at 4:00 am at TSA checkpoint.,2

Airport,Traveling for work on a Sunday? Not the best. Southern collard greens ramen from oneflewsouthatl? The best! Definitely not your traditional ramen but every element of it was delicious on its own and together. Never have eaten anything that hasn't been fantastic here and it's airport food! Missing my dining companion the4bz.,2
Airport,"This airport and the crazy drivers will make you think twice about moving to this state lol. If you're flying in from a small town or city, prepare to be shocked. If you're flying in from New York or similar, you'll fit right in 👍",2
Aquarium,Could not see anything 😂 and there is a lady saying you cannot stand up. 🚫👀🐬,2
AZM,"Not half as exciting as its made out to be but gave it a try since the ticket to the aquarium came as a combo.
nothing to be very great honestly unless one is excited by the brand name and wants to check it off the bucket list",2
Theme Park,"Rides always break down, food is overly expensive and for low portions.",2
Museum,The rocket park and training center were cool to see. Many of the interactive exhibits are broken and underwhelming. Space Center is aging poorly and is overpriced for the value.,2
Airport,"(Translated by Google) Dated building, little choice of restaurants (Original)",2
Museum,"Slightly disappointing IMHO.  It seemed more geared towards small children and there were lots of empty spaces with no exhibits.  In addition on the second floor none of the displays were working, so it was hard to tell what you were looking at",2
Garden,"Beautiful place and friendly staff unfortunately there is a thief in housekeeping. We went to dinner and returned to our room to discover someone had gone through my suitcase and stole several items. Not happy at all, feeling violated.",2
Airport,I have flown through many airports and this is my least favorite. Every time I come through here half the moving sidewalks are off and if you are lucky enough to be at one of the very far gates you can expect to walk at least 3/4 of a mile or more with all your stuff by the time your done. Wish this place was better designed. Getting to and from rental cars is also a pain because of the distance.,2
Airport,This airport is wild 😜😜 No kinda structure... Really not feeling this one 🙄🙄,2
Airport,Crazy busy even with Clear at 5:00am,2
Airport,The trains are often very crowded. And Uber Rider share is far away from other forms of transportation,2

Attraction,"Interestingly their Ramen restaurant was fine given its location in a theme park. Miso ramen with Port Belly recommended.
All the rides were too small to cover this many people. Not recommending any ride.",2
Attraction,I was a little disappointed on my first visit. Since many of the rides were not open. And not many vendors are open during weekdays.,2
Theme Park,"Loved the staff, they had a really Nice Vibe. The actual rides were such a dissapointment tho.",2
Airport,My first time landing and departing. I’m convinced 20% of the crowd walking around in here are as lost as we were. Long wait at baggage claim and there are very limited options for charging your devices.,2
Museum,Not enough to see and the figures were not authentic enough. Felt like it was a lot of money for very little to see.,2
AZM,Pretty ok employees were kind of rude and it's not very big,2
Airport,"Old, super long cues, very long walks. Car rental is very far away. My least favorite airport in US.",2
AZM,"One star for the great annimals.One star for the garden.Withdraw  of 3 stars , because disabled people  get no discount but additional they have to pay 27 USD for a scooter. This is absolutely unacceptele discrimination.",2
Zoo,Lots of of things are under construction or non existent. Paid full price with 3 kids. No parking. Can’t wait to visit when improvements have been made.,2

Attraction,"Not great for the value
We stayed at the castle and it was very mediocre they don't offer a much entertainment as the other resort the aquarium was very packed for a slow day it felt rushed and most of the rides weren't working",2
Airport,"Love the city... but the organization of this airport is so screwed up you can't find anything, not enough signs to direct you where you want to go. Even the Tram driver said that most of his riders have been misdirected by signs or the lack of them.
I've been at much larger airports that are far better organized.",2
Airport,Not enough seating in terminal B.,2
Airport,"🤔Just asked KLM / Delta representative at MSP for terminal and connection insight at AMS (Amsterdam).

His answer, ""I have no clue. I have not been there in twelve years.""

And they expect loyalty from passengers? #CustomerService #customerexperience",2
Airport,They don't have many places that accept cash.,2
Airport,I have TSA precheck and was directed through the airport to the lines that process precheck and CLEAR travelers. I would have done better in the regular lines. Precheck literally took over an hour to get through security!Do better Atlanta!,2
Zoo,"Visited in the winter, most restaurants were closed and lots of animals were not out. Train is closed for a year.",2
Attraction,"We visited during weekday, no wait or minimum wait on line.
Do not buy the photo package!!! It is a scam!! I got strangest on my account and missing my own pictures including the entrance and 2 other locations. The ones I got are bad quality, blurry. Save some money and use your phone.",2

Sports,"Always missing something, fries are either too hard or soggy and bread is always soggy.",2
Museum,Way to many people for such little place everyone running everywhere and could not get staff to help when asking for help,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) Funny thing is it doesn&#39;t work (Original),2
Theme Park,They offered a special tasting of 5 items and discounted drinks.  The lines were so long that we did not get our 5 items.  We waited 45 minutes for hot chocolate.   Several booths only had one person working.   Not enough help caused slow lines.,2
Museum,We paid $32/person. Everything interactive inside was at an extra charge. We tried to take the tour trolley but it was sold out. Was NOT impressed.,2
Aquarium,"Overrated place, super crowded and very less organized.",2
Theme Park,"For the price of things, very little to do. 80 bucks go to a glorified market with a few rides (admittedly they are good rides though). Friendly people and beautiful grounds, but just nowhere near worth what they ask to get inside and park.",2
Airport,"Frontier did my bestie dirty. Destiny S is not a professional manager at all. Cussing at customers, caused 7+ people to miss their flight and was blaming them for it. Left a new worker by herself to deal with something she doesn’t have authority to do. By the end all the other workers were talking smack on Destiny for being a horrible manager.",2
Aquarium,"They don’t have a college student discount… every other museum/institution in Chicago does.
It’s expensive.
We had to wait 30 minutes to get in.",2
Theme Park,"Steal your dollar city! Had fun with wife and two teenagers. BUT!! for over $400 to get in the door, I could have found something better. Then once inside we dropped another $400. Not very practical on the check book.",2
Airport,Busy and chaotic but there is a method to the madness.,2
Theme Park,"Well, we were very disappointed because the train ride this year have bearly any Christmas lights to see. Come on I brought family from a different state and I was disappointed to even show them the train ride. I have ridden before during Christmas so I know many lights were missing",2
Airport,"At Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. I pre-ordered a wheelchair for Mom.  Delta Air Lines was out of wheelchairs at 8:30am. There were dozens of people waiting for chairs. Andre Dickens Disapppinting that on the busiest weekend of the year, they were not prepared for people who could not walk the distance.",2
Airport,"Not too early of a flight, but the idenfication security check didn't have enough TSA personnel for the number of passengers, so the process went quite slowly. Heard several travelers state they'd probably miss their flight.",2
Attraction,Overpriced.  Only worth going once if you can get free or discounted tickets.  Staff could care less about your experience.  Long waits for rides even on an off day.,2
Theme Park,"Too woke. They are after your children with a
Hidden agenda",2
Theme Park,I am upset over the black out dates on a season pass for next year guess i wont be going,2
Museum,They went to the moon. They are trying to go to Mars. They cannot have an app that works.,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) Doesn&#39;t seem to be operating normally (Original),2
Theme Park,Did not like this park as much as I wanted to.  Venues were difficult to find and get to.  Timing between shows located near each other made it difficult to get to on time.  Lack of variety in food venues.  Many of the rides were closed.,2
Airport,If you need wheelchair ♿️ service it sucks no matter how early you get there smh,2
Airport,The airport facility is great - the. TSA experience is lousy!,2
Airport,It is the most confusing airport in the country. The signage is awful same area with signs pointing  different directions for the same destination with in 5 feet of each other.,2
Airport,"Beware if delays. And they will make you wait a looooong time. Flight got delayed, and canceled and delayed again!",2
Airport,"Clean airport but TSA personnel is not qualified, can’t help, don’t know nothing - not very customer friendly and nearly missed my flight because they had to scan my laptop (?????) 3-times.",2
AZM,I'm disappointed that as members that every time we go there the Water Ride is closed :(. It was one of the reasons we got the passes,2
Attraction,"I really do not like this theme park.  My youngest son loves it, that is the only reason we come.  Everything looks old and dirty.  I wish they had done a better job of taking care of the place.",2
Attraction,I was enjoying Legoland up untilI saw this little black lego  girl tucked away behind Lego dinosaur,2
AZM,Set up is weird. No flow to it. Everything is really spread out. Safari ride was pointless for as long as we had to wait.,2
AZM,One of America's oldest and best Zoo's. Clean and well maintained. Animal habitats are in good condition and well positioned for animal viewing. Very active in the community and in conservation efforts. Be sure to visit; you will not be disappointed! Have visited multiple times.,2
Airport,Nice airport but a lot of the electrical plugs along the walls and in the seats don't work in terminal D. Not a business friendly airport.,2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Too expensive for that. Too expensive for a small aquarium. There are sharks, rays, seahorses, but forgot about jellyfish 😀 (Original) Too expensive for that. Too expensive for a small aquarium. There are sharks, rays, seahorses, but forgot about jellyfish 😀",2
Theme Park,"Commons Restaurant blind sided us with an automatic 38% gratuity charge on the bill, on top of $40 per person charge for Thanksgiving buffet.",2
Airport,Very huge. Somewhat confusing. No store takes cash. No smoking sections except outside the main entrance to airport.,2
Airport,"TSA is a complete joke. If they moved any slower they would go backwards. TSA agents directing people to the wrong line, etc.",2
Theme Park,"The kids had fun. The kids threshold age at most is 10. The park itself is run horribly, everything moves excruciatingly slow. If this place was efficient you could see and do everything in 3 hours. Being slow must be the method to their madness so you don’t feel ripped off for the $100 a person.",2
Airport,Why is it so hot in here I swear it's like 75 degrees in A,2
Airport,"So my son and I flew with Breeze Airline out of Bradly.The first thing I had an issue with is lack of direction,and how unfriendly the tsa staff were.They were almost hostile and definitely unpolite!",2
Theme Park,A bit much for the prices. I mean 25$ just for parking? Get real,2
Airport,"So awful - you'd think they never had a crowd before. On a Sunday morning, not during a holiday or any other particularly busy travel time (early Nov) there was a 45 minute wait for coffee and a 30 minute wait at a different food place I tried. Security is a mess - miles of walking to then wait in miles of lines - and that's for TSA precheck. Come on ATL!",2
Airport,If you are in a wheelchair please use the family rest room before you go through TSA. There are no family assisted rest rooms at the gates. They have rest rooms where you can relieve your pet animals but no wheelchair accessible family restrooms. How dumb is that?,2
Theme Park,"Crowded, tons of traffic, average entertainment value. Incredibly expensive",2
Theme Park,Dollywood has absolutely made it so passes are no longer worth the money!!!! Blackout dates for Silver Season Pass Holders!!!!,2
Garden,"My husband took me to see the lights since I had never been. Needless to say, we didn't go in. We had two children with us, and we wasn't fixing to spend $40/person to see Christmas lights!! That is just RIDICULOUS!!! I can understand $40/vehicle maybe, but not per person!!",2
Airport,"YOU CAN’T REFILL YOUR WATER BOTTLE because they only have gross water fountains and not the dispensers like all other major airports have!   The amount of plastic water bottles that Atlanta airport generates is a sin.

My gate is also noisy with a loud basketball game on the loud speaker.

Large selection of food choices and nice support people.",2
Museum,Started to go inside. Lines for security check were long and one security guard kinda rude barking orders to paying customers was a turn-off. Ended up leaving,2
Theme Park,"Not for big folks!
I’m 6”0 and 278 and could only ride 3 rides.   Even average people we crammed  in on most rides.  In a town with 20 buffets you would think most rides would fit 2x men.  But the Christmas lights are absolutely beautiful!!!!",2
Garden,Turn the music up a little bit more on the trolley we could not hardly hear it for people talking.,2
AZM,"Except for the game where you walk on heights, nothing exciting.",2
AZM,"We showed up with cash they said that they only took card, didn't see that anywhere on the website. Definitely drove an hour with two excited kids just to tell them sorry they won't take our money.",2
AZM,Wonder works wasn’t too bad but again no workers on hand so half of the things within it you couldn’t participate in bc no one was there to run it,2
AZM,Half of exhibits do not work. Needs updating. Even soap bubble area not nice anymore. Waste of time.,2
AZM,Very limited staff and a lot of the attractions are run down. High cost for not much. They had some biggerridesonside but no one to run them. Also when we went to play laser tag the lady setring it up wasnt very friendly.  The kiddie canyon was closed but the big one was open.,2
AZM,Everything was broken and no one was around to run the rides,2
AZM,Lots of broken activities. Not good for really young children. Dirty...,2
AZM,wasn't  impressed at all with our visit. over priced and alot of the stuff was out of order and didn't  work. Definitely  won't be going back,2
AZM,"Needs a facelift.  Many ""attractions"" closed and the place was filthy.  The concession stand was disgusting.",2
AZM,Alot of attractions don't work. Place is getting old and in need of refreshing.  Pretty run down.,2
AZM,"Do not be fooled by the upside down appearance of the building. On the outside it looks interesting, but this place is for kids ages 4 to 13. Great for families, not for adult only tourists!!!!",2
AZM,It was okay. The kids enjoyed it some but the younger ones were disappointed that they couldn’t ride the rides. It was not worth $144 at all. I wouldn’t go back.,2
AZM,Weight limits for everything. Don't come and waste your time if your over 250 pounds.,2
AZM,"Not worth the money, and the lines are to long for everything . It’s nothing exciting to see and it’s confusing to walk through . Go to one of the small arcades around pcb you will have more fun.",2
AZM,Definitely not good for smaller children and likely not a value at any age.,2
AZM,The price is too high or I'd give it better star ratings.,2
AZM,Alot of equipment was not working. Disappointing for the price.,2
AZM,"Crowded, and very expensive for just a few attractions.",2
AZM,It sucked. Maybe for little kids. Two rides as we were standing in line stopped and had to be serviced. And was postponed. We left within the hour.,2
AZM,"Not terrible,  not what we were expecting, and really expensive for what you get.  Some cool things but overall disappointment",2
AZM,Place is great for the kids. Most of their interactive things don't work as well as they are supposed to. Lines are long. If your kid is at the hight requirement they still say too short but charge you anyway.,2
AZM,It was too expensive and half of the stuff in there wasn't working they need to have more stuff for the kids too,2
AZM,Over priced for half there attractions to be down. Do better,2
AZM,It was okay best part was the entrance. Although most interactive things like Google maps was down..looks short staffed as any tourist places can't find anyone to work,2
AZM,"Ridiculous ride wait times! Been in line for Gravedigger for 85 minutes and there are still 30 people ahead of me. Entire place is too crowded, expensive and all you will do is wait in line. Save your hard earned money !!",2
AZM,"We went on a stormy day to get the kids out of the house. So did all of Florida apparently. The lines were extremely long, a lot of the attractions weren't properly maintained or working at all. Overall it wasn't worth the money.",2
AZM,Very crowded.  Most of the attractions were not working properly.,2
AZM,"$150 I will never see again.  Many exhibits broken, Lazer tag lame.  Way to highly priced for the gimmick it is.",2
AZM,The price of the ticket should be alot less since 5 of the main attractions were broken.,2
AZM,"It’s just not what it use to be…
Needs an upgrade.
Several attractions either do not work or are completely out of service.
Overpriced to say the least.",2
AZM,$140 for 3 adults and 1 child (5) and ALOT was out of order we didn’t even see laser tag and we were through everything in less than 1 hour seems really run down,2
AZM,It could have been better if all the exhibits worked. It is a great idea but I think lacks maintenance. So lots of things could not be experienced.,2
AZM,The new ride was a 17 minute turn over per ride.  We had to wait an hour for our turn.  Some items were broke. Only one coster open. But 2 employees on that ride.  Man the facility.,2
AZM,Many of the attractions/activities were not working and needed to be repaired or replaced 😐,2
AZM,they dont have sweet tea😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡,2
AZM,I don’t know but for what I paid i feel like I was ripped off $200 wasn’t worth it for me and my kids!!,2
AZM,"Cool place, but way way too crowded. They really should limit the amount of tickets per hour? Can’t enjoy the cool activities if you are packed in like that. Plus it’s really expensive. Dissatisfied overall.",2
AZM,The place looks interesting but ticket was too pricey so i didn't enter.,2
AZM,Magic show was good but it’s not all you can eat. I got 2 slices of pizza and then I was told they were behind and couldn’t get pizza out fast enough for everyone.,2
AZM,Mediocre at best. Nothing more than an overpriced video arcade and low quality food.  On busy weekends there's no parking to be had.,2
AZM,"$37 for an upscaled Chuck E Cheese experience.

Expected more of a focus on science instead of just an arcade for kids.",2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Too expensive for nothing exceptional... (Original) Too expensive, for nothing exceptional...",2
AZM,"35 dollar tickets! far overpriced for what it is.
Two stars for the few (3) exhibits that were cool. Four exhibits were out of order with no signs of being fixed any time soon. Arcade, rope course and laser tag were small and out dated. Deezer land is nearby 🤷‍♂️ j.s.",2
AZM,"Neat building on the outside, but rather pricey for what they offer. Many of the things are in disrepair, had a good time anyway. There is definitely more affordable fun options.",2
AZM,"It was ok. Too long to get in , even with tickets that were bought online. Too busy on week day. Undewelming and could be cleaner. Staff is not feiendly.",2
AZM,It was not what I expected. There were 3 floors. And everything they had was for kids . If you have kids they will love it,2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Very expensive, not what you imagine from the outside. It really is better to see it from the outside. (Translated by Google) Very expensive, it is not what you imagine from the outside. It really is better to see it from the outside.",2
AZM,"Ok, this is 2022 but this looks like and attraction made for 1998 or maybe 1995, it is very old fashion dirty and expensive.",2
AZM,Not impressed. The admission is pricey especially when large groups of people come in all at one time and you can’t enjoy what the facility has to offer.,2
AZM,"Definitely for the tourist only that plan on never returning it’s the exact same stuff 13 years or possibly more, I personally feel
things should be upgraded in here. A little more sanitary also due to the hands on activities.",2
AZM,Kind of expensive. Not all the exhibits we're open.,2
AZM,Cool idea however a lot of stuff is outdated and doesn’t work,2
AZM,It's ok if u are 3 years of age or under a waste of money,2
AZM,Expensive for content and exhibits and no air con. Prepare to lose body fluids to then spend $3.50 to replace them.,2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Only that inside nothing is the other way around haha

Solo que por dentro nada es al revés jaja",2

AZM,"(Translated by Google) Old attractions and without maintenance, several activities do not work, place in decay, do not waste your money! (Translated by Google) Old and unmaintained attractions, several activities do not work, a decaying site, do not waste your money!",2
AZM,"Disappointed
The sight of the upside down house is still amazing. Kids minds were blown! But inside it was not the science-type museum I remember. Now much more arcade based and many of the exhibits weren’t working properly. We struggled to fill 2 hours for over $125. Disappointed.",2
AZM,Looks awesome on the outside but this is more for smaller kids. We spend $100 on almost nothing to do. You can't be over 250 on the rides which they didn't tell you before you paid. Not impressed at all!,2
AZM,My 3 yo grand son could not do much here and it was too busy.,2
AZM,it was expensive plus it had to many people in the lines u sat there the arcade was ok best part but not the best if there was a lot less people it would be great,2
AZM,"Not enough attendants at the different set ups, hand sanitizer out in most places, no 6 ft distance cause too over crowded. Not enough benches to sit at and let kids explore. Things should be more clearly marked, levels and such.",2
AZM,"Great for kids but nothing really for adults to do. Lines were long. Several things were broken, definitely felt like I wasted $75..",2
AZM,"Wouldn't take cash until they realized we were just going to leave then it changed, had alot of neat activities the best ones didn't work felt the need to keep my hands clean but all their hand sanitizers were empty .",2
AZM,"Outside of building was best thing about it. Was ok place for kids if all the attractions inside were working and staffed but, they are not. For the price I'd recommend a different attraction.",2
AZM,Need to work on the elevator service or have another route for mothers with strollers or wheelchairs,2
AZM,The place is always so crowded that you don't get to enjoy everything.  The lines are always long.,2
AZM,We were excited to come here but disappointed. Half the exhibits didn't work and what they don't tell you is this is mostly for big kids. 4 and under don't have much too do. We waited in line longer than it took to get through the exhibits.,2
AZM,Half the rides were properly working..  hour wait times for all rides. 100 bucks for 3 people to stand in line for 95% of the time,2
AZM,It was not what we expected.  My grandson is 5 and kept covering his ears because it was too noisy.  Part of the nose came from the overhead music. Not worth the money,2
AZM,Not having a separate line for those who have already purchased tickets online is indicative of how poorly the facility is managed. Waited in line an hour. There are no obviously visible maps of the activities in the building.,2
AZM,Pricey and only 40 - 60% worth if you have kids less than age 9.,2
AZM,Not sensory friendly and alot smaller than advertised,2
AZM,"It is a cool place, I probably wouldn’t return. The power went out and it knocked all the games off line… The attendants wouldn’t let the ladies in my group ride some of the rides because of their “dresses”… overall 3/10",2
AZM,Some of the stuff did not work or there were no one to run the simulators.,2
AZM,A little steep in pricing for what there is available. Several of the activities didn't work completely or partially run down. Would do it again. My 9 year old did have fun but got bored easily after short time.,2
AZM,I was upset that they didn't let me son ride some rides and rock climb because he only had sandles on. They should have told people to wear inclosed shoes beforehand.,2
AZM,Way to expensive for what it is. The drink and snack kitchen wasn't even open on the top floor so you had to go all the way to bottom. Several things wasn't working either. Just wasn't my cup of tea.,2
AZM,"It was super crowded and not the type of thing my kids enjoyed. My kids were to young for some of the rides, so that may have been a factor.",2
AZM,The staff make zero effort to disinfect any surfaces,2
AZM,"Neat place, pretty busy when we went through which made it hard to enjoy it thoroughly. Took our 3 year old, there wasn't much she could enjoy. Much better suited for older kids. Will return when our little one is big enough to be there.",2
AZM,Very disappointed for the price.  Not friendly for very young due to to height restrictions. Geared to older kids.  An arcade with some kid activities... and many of those were broke or turned off.  I honestly can't recommend this for the family for that price.,2
AZM,Fun place. But the one climbing wall they had taken forever bc the lady in charge of it was a bit of a crabby troll,2
AZM,A lot of the interactive stuff didn't work. Still had a good time with what did work.,2
AZM,"Meh
This place is not worth the money. Laser tag was fun. They had several activities that were not working. And some needed more explanation for the kids to do. Spend your time and money on things to do outside like caves.",2
AZM,"Not good
Brochure is very misleading.  Looks very exciting and like it is a lot of rides but it's actually only a few rides. My daughter was 1 inch to short to ride the main one she was interested in. Long lines and long wait times. Definitely not for a child with sensitivity to sounds.",2
AZM,"It was alright
I really wanted to like this place. Interactive science exhibits just aren’t that rare for them to be so flippant. It seemed half of the displays or exhibits were broken or closed. The lines for the rides were about an hour long. The laser tag was probably the best part.",2
AZM,"Expensive for a zoo 200 dollars for a family of 4 just to get in, we ordered 3 lemonades inside for 28 dollars.  ""Kids"" are 11 and under, 11 and over get charged as an adult, watch out large families.",2
Zoo,The Zoo lights were pretty disappointing this year! $50 spent on 2 tickets was overpriced and underwhelmed!,2

AZM,Nacho cheese was ice cold. Cheese was actually colder than it was outside,2
Airport,Tsa line is long... get to the airport about 3hrs before ur flight is advised,2
Garden,The hot chocolate was very good but the lights display was really a disappointment. And honestly it was a lot better the last time I went which truthfully that was 25 years ago.,2
Airport,Got stuck at airport for 5 hours as flight was delayed.,2
Aquarium,(Translated by Google) just wasn&#39;t good (Original),2
Theme Park,Seams to me the DREAM MORE  part is all about dreaming about being able to afford this place,2
Theme Park,Over priced. The rides are not made anyone who is considered big keep that in mind when coming here definitely family-oriented the lights were pretty much the only redeeming thing here not to mention the park is not wheelchair accessible,2
Theme Park,Watched some dude get robbed and then later I went into the bathroom and he was with another man doing the naughty.,2
Airport,Handicapped and had to wait 20+ minutes for a wheelchair and assistance.,2
Museum,we vacation in myrtle beach the first week in November but because my son is autistic we can't visit wonderworks. please have more sensory days !!!,2
Airport,Delta connection so close we didnt see ANY of the airport except the train. <B-((,2
Airport,"A really arduous journey to International departure.
Ugh.
Bus ride and only 4 desk clerks checking in.",2
Theme Park,Very steep hills make this a place of torture. I know they can’t help it but this is your warning. Lol,2
Museum,"Exhibition was okay and some look very dated. Anyway, they seriously need to work on their staff training. Most of them were rude and didn't make us feel welcoming at all.",2
Theme Park,"Legoland unfortunately was not a good experience . Everything is dated and unorganized . We went in December . Sorry to say , but is not worth the money.",2
Theme Park,The food is bad and  way too crowded. They should stop letting people in after a certain amount.,2
Airport,Another subsidized fossil fuel driven transportation hub. Compare how much public funds are spent here versus train or bus stations.,2
Museum,So much broken! Only about half of the exhibits are actually operational. My local children's museum that costs less than 1/3 the price is better.,2
Airport,"Waiting for our luggage-- midway through they switch to a different turnstyle--from #7 to #11 and didn't tell anyone-- people had rides waiting-and you can't have your car there long without having to keep moving it
Other times it has been just fine-- but NOT ON FRIDAY",2
Airport,"Airport facilities are well kept but the building functions are poorly designed and inefficient for its purpose. You pick up your luggage on the ground floor, then Stand in long line for the elevator longer than the ticket line for a World Series in order to get to the second level to cross the bridge to the covered garage.",2
Museum,"(Translated by Google) It is very neglected, there are a lot of homeless people on the entire avenue, the truth is that it takes away its attractiveness (Original) attractive",2
Airport,It was absolutely FREEZING at our gate!! It makes no sense that you pay to take a flight and have to wear your winter coat inside the airport.  DO BETTER,2
Museum,"Overpriced
It was just ok. There aren't very many wax figures for the price you pay. I would not do it again. Save your money for other area attractions.",2
Aquarium,I wish they had a better system of getting people in when it's busy. Waited in line almost three hours in the freezing cold.,2
Theme Park,"I would like to go to a place that ls a little bit more for my age
Young children may like the fact that it is peppa pig themed but older children might find it boring. No offence to peppa pig fans.",2
Airport,"Delta lost my luggage. Regular staff unconcerned about the carousel not working for over an hour. Only saving grace was Delta employee Geraldine -- she gave me some Bugles because I was starving after 2 hrs of waiting. Also, TGIF required hostess to seat you yet there wasn't one for the 30 minutes I waited. Again, thank goodness for Geraldine and the Bugles",2
AZM,It was neat but I would have rather spent the time at other attractions. If you are staying for a week then sure you should go here to atleast see it.,2
AZM,We have gone several times as my child has grown up unfortunately this last trip to Orlando wasn't as exciting as the 1st few times we have visited. Half of the attractions were closed down and everything looked a little worn down and dirty needs a face lift and a good cleaning.,2
Airport,Bad signage inside rental car offices misleading  people trying to make the right escalator  to departure gates.,2
Airport,"Very busy, but businesses close too early",2
Airport,"I live in MSP and have traveled domestically more than your mother has. With that, I’ve come to realize it’s just another MN distraction! Clean, with things you like, but functionality, forget it. Just another garbage airport. Don’t fall for the free popcorn",2
Theme Park,This place does not accept cash! Ridiculous that places in the USA do not take cash money.,2
Airport,"MSP was my layover airport to my next destination, and I will avoid it from now onwards.

Airport itself and the lounges were nice, but Delta delayed my luggage here and it's been stuck at this airport for three days. No one is answering the phone either in their baggage center. If you're flying Delta through here — beware.",2
Airport,The TSA was a little rude to people.  Just one of the agents .,2
Aquarium,Trying to purchase gift cards for Christmas and your online ticket portal /website is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Customer service was just as bad when I called to speak with a representative.,2
Museum,"There’s lots here but forcing people to wait hours for a tram instead being allowed to, you know, walk is ridiculous. I’ve never been to an aerospace venue like that you can always just walk around",2
Airport,"It’s OK at best. Yes, it is super busy but that doesn’t justify the markup on food and merchandise compared to other airports. If you think the pricing is bad, you should try to find a working outlet to charge your phone. GOOD LUCK. if you do find an outlet for your charger it will be totally worn out and your charger will just fall out.  GOOD LUCK.",2

Museum,A few things were out of order and it was too busy for comfort.,2
Airport,"Do you ever get 757 withdrawal? I saw this beauty in ATL a few days ago and it made me realize I haven't been on a 757 in about a month. 😭 I need to fly them more! Sadly flying from LAX makes it shockingly hard to catch one.

Airport,My least favorite airport. By far the dirtiest.,2
Aquarium,We went when Santa was there it's not worth it line so big  at end  to buy your pictures,2
Airport,they cancelled my flight after i waited for HOURS on end when they knew they weren’t going to be able to get a pilot and the airport is refusing to let me retrieve my luggage. ruined christmas.,2
Aquarium,(Translated by Google) I visited it about 2 years ago but what I didn&#39;t like is that the second time I came they didn&#39;t sell tickets at the entrance (Original) It&#39;s that the second time I came they didn&#39;t sell tickets at the entrance,2
AZM,The pol aquariums are very pretty but it breaks my heart to see little penguins and penguins and otters locked up all their lives in a place where they never see the light of day,2
Theme Park,The fast pass program is starting to make it harder to ride anything.,2
Aquarium,Wouldn't waste the money for this place there is only a few things to see,2
Theme Park,"Christmas,  lights and lines!
5 stars for the lights and shows, 0 stars for the rides and lines. Lines for EVERYTHING! bathroom, 10 minutes, rides 2 hours, shows 1 hour, food 30 minutes. Half the rides are closed. It's pretty, but it tries your patience.",2
Theme Park,The crowd was moderate but everything that was open had lines 45. To 100 minute wait...,2
Theme Park,"Avoid this place
Way too expensive!!!!  The workers are rude and nasty to everyone.  Wait time is too long for younger children.  Not for 5 and under.  Food is also terrible. Won’t be back and neither will my family.",2
Theme Park,The park has become exceptionally crowded (especially during December) over the last five years.  The rides just aren’t worth waiting 1-2 hours.  I say this as someone who’s gone to Dollywood for 20 years and used to live it.  They need to cap ticket sales!,2
Airport,"(Translated by Google) Old and endless queues

(Original)
Vecchio e code infinite",2
Theme Park,"Meh
I would recommend visiting in the summer. We went between Christmas and New Years and very little was open in the park, which is disappointing for kids … yet still expensive for parents.",2
Museum,It was ok but really over priced for the few things you can do with a 4 yr old yeah they have a flight simulator and it was messed up for almost 40 dollars a ticket I was kinda expecting more options for smaller children,2
Airport,Lack of signs at a few key points is disappointing.,2
Theme Park,Train ride was closed. Tv commercials showed it open and the ticket site didn't either. That for us was the main reason we went.,2
Theme Park,I did not like the idea of a business having a picture of my child. Just for a season ticket. Might rethink my purchase next year,2
Airport,Parking is not clearly marked for delta parking in the west,2
Theme Park,Handicap people walk entirely too far to get to a tram,2
Airport,"They need to work on the location for the Uber and lyft pickups, it is not well covered, we had a baby and it was very cold and rainy and the Uber guy said they are not allowed to pick up passengers at the terminal.",2
Museum,(Translated by Google) I expected something more or more interaction. It was very short and simple for the 30$ that the entrance costs (Original) I expected something more or more interaction. It was very short and simple for the 30$ that the entrance costs,2
Aquarium,I'm sorry but this wasn't worth 45$ per person. It was so jam packed that It was almost impossible to enjoy. They really need to not let so many people in. If it wasn't so packed it would have been much better. We went during the week too!,2
Theme Park,"$68 for 2 adults and 2 kids to walk trough mirrors for 3 min.  Not worth the money. Get a full access pass or choose a different attraction altogether. Kids enjoyed it, just not worth the money.",2
Garden,I have to say that I’m pretty disappointed that they raised the ticket prices but a lot of the lights are OUT!! Multiple fairy’s were half lit the trees on the pond were almost all the way out (bulbs burned out) I wish they would fix this to make it worth the money!,2
Theme Park,Too crowded to enjoy anything. Waited hours and hours in line.,2

(Translated by Google) We arrived and there was no longer a free tour, we only walked through the initial exhibition. Unfortunately we travel a lot.",2

Aquarium,(Translated by Google) The venue is too small (Original) The venue is too small,2
Airport,"Pro tip, new years eve at 7pm, not one restaurant is open in terminal B",2
Aquarium,"Super overcrowded. They have time slots set up, but they do not use them. From what we could see it looked like a nice place, we just couldn't work our way close enough to really check out any of the displays.
Fairly expensive for what you get with the crowds.
Overall a disappointing experience.",2
Aquarium,(Translated by Google) the place is too small (Original),2
Theme Park,"Spent a lot of $$$ to bring 10 to the park on the 28.
So many people. Huge lines for bathrooms and rides. Most drink spots closed- min 1-2 hour wait to get a drink.
Never again.",2
AZM,(Translated by Google) Not good for the price full of small fish (Original),2
Theme Park,"It was more than a little crowded, and made it an unpleasant experience. January 29, 2022. They ran out of food, many food places closed so very long lines. Lines for every thing.",2
Airport,Hated the attitude of the skycap porter outside of the Southwest check in. All else was manageable but not a great experience. Super backed up and rushed.,2
Zoo,"Went to Denver zoo in December and was extremely disappointed by the amount of animals I saw. 75% of the exhibits were empty or closed. Yet I paid full price.
Of the animals I saw, there was a great variety and unique animals I’ve never seen before.",2
Theme Park,There are rides for little kids and teenagers but nothing in-between.  Very disappointing.,2
Airport,Flights sucked .... not the airports fault airport was good but the flight control was awful,2
Airport,"(Translated by Google) super crowded! Too many people

(Original)
Super concurrido! Demasiadas personas",2
AZM,A glorified arcade at an inflated cost.  Some of things were not working and other items lackedinstructions.   Save your money.,2
Airport,"Nobody is helpful, if anything the staff are rude. The place is clean enough until you get into the bathrooms. Overall, I would never fly through this place again if it could be helped.",2
Theme Park,"Way too many people!  Exceptionally long lines for everything...2 hours to eat, 1 hour to get a drink or snack, and 1 1/2 hour wait to ride numerous rides.  Museum closed too.   The lights were absolutely beautiful!  Will not be returning.☹️",2
AZM,Well....    That was boring. Screaming kids everywhere and not much to see.....     Wouldn't recommend. VERY expensive as well.,2
Airport,Had to abort landing and then circle back. Then took 45 minutes to get a gate open and another 15 to get a jetway.  Then we had to run to a train and nearly middle our connection. Once back to the plane spent 30 minutes deicing.  Overall mehh.,2
Airport,No cash options to buy food/beverage,2
AZM,"A lot of the exhibits are pretty janky from abusive use and lack of repairs.
I don’t think this establishment is worth the money they charge.",2
Theme Park,I had trouble using my charge plate at 1 of your souvenir stores.  You guys need to upgrade your charge plate systems and so that you can tap n pay as well.,2
Aquarium,We didn't get to see the shows because they were sold out. I think they said limited tickets for social distancing which didn't make sense because the whole aquarium was full and you were always close to somebody,2
Airport,"The airport inside, when you first arrive, has horrible signage. There are no signs posted that I ever saw for the car rental area. I walked thru the airport for literally 10 minutes before I got so feed up I stopped to ask an airport worker.",2
Zoo,You see more animals at the Colorado Spring zoo than here.,2
Aquarium,1/2 what it used to be 20 years ago… and …$94 for 2 tickets …. seriously!!??!  dismal,2
Zoo,Made reservations online to take the family here however I was sad to find out that alot of the exhibits weren't available there was no information about this on the website.,2
Airport,"It's very small and an easy time thru TSA. However, it needs a lot of upgrades to the worn-out phone chargers that can't even hold a plug and those outdated restrooms.",2
Museum,"Not really worth the trip. $65 for admission for two.
The parking lot was packed and it took 15 minutes to find a spot, even with prepaid parking.
Not much to see inside and it was extremely crowded.

Just watch a video tour of the place and save a lot of time.",2
Garden,"The amount of that we spent there, they were so disorganized for Fantasy in Lights...",2
Airport,TSA was unusually slow on the international side of the airport. They were very professional to me. But to the supervisor I was with they asked them a very inappropriate and personal question which had nothing to do with the TSA operation.,2
Zoo,"Kali, (Female Sumatran Tiger) just like your house kitty, is pretty sure that lunch is late, and wonders what the hell you are going to do about it.",2
Theme Park,Careful buying tickets to any drone shows. If they cancel because of their own technical issues then you're out of luck. I can understand no response if it's canceled due to weather or 'act of god' but technical difficulties is a cost of business,2
Zoo,Animals don't appear to be cared for.... And every thing is dirty,2
Airport,"The queue through passport control took us over 2 hours.

Only 2 border staff checking.

As we were transferring our hand lugga had to be rescreened and only one line open....

But one of our best airport meals... Did not expect a US airport to offer health thy or tasty food",2
Attraction,Hotel staff doesn't replace sheets between guests. Family contracted scabies from Castle Hotel. December 2022.,2
AZM,"Attendant in the children's area, specifically the banana ride, was obviously more interested in his phone than his job. Bathroom in the same area was absolutely disgusting.",2
Attraction,"Some rides closed today, dragon included until the 29/1",2
Museum,Went to see Galaxy lights.  This was disappointing at best.  Their are better Christmas light shows.  Don't waste your money on Nasa's,2
Museum,"They aren't open until 9pm on Fridays anymore. Looks like I won't be renewing my membership. Edit: Thanks for the response. I checked last week, January the 20th and the latest time slot was 4pm and the website said m-f 9-5. You may also want to update the Google maps hours.",2
Aquarium,Staff seem to be preoccupied and would rather be any other place.  Food is over priced. Bathrooms are filthy.,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) doesn&#39;t feel real (Original) doesn&#39;t feel real (Original),2
Museum,Many of the wax figures didn't look like the celebrities,2
Theme Park,"My last visit was VERY disappointing. Only one stage show was performing and was so crowded I couldn't get in. The majority of rides were closed and even the craftsmen weren't doing demonstrations.  The Christmas tree light show was nice, but overall not worth the price of admission.",2
Airport,"Planes were stuck on the runway for an hour and cars couldn't wait in safe spaces for their passengers. Under the circumstances and it was 8 PM seems like some kind of accommodation could be made, instead the police said to pay for parking or go to the new cell lot, which no one could find.",2
Aquarium,Feels too crammed for a world’s third largest aquarium,2
Airport,It's okay.  Big airport and very confusing with poor staff communication.,2
Theme Park,"Need some cleaning, and the waiting time is boring and too long.",2
Airport,Ticket takers at gates are always miserable. Most lazy people at any food concessions. Food closes early and half the places are either out of food or permanently closed. I fly through here frequently and always disappointed. Can never seem to get a good meal here. Least favorite airport to fly through. Talking specifically concourse c.,2
Airport,"I like flying Delta, enough to be a diamond for 6 years, hate dealing with Atlanta gate agents.  They are the rudest gate agents Delta has.  Every time I’ve asked for their help it’s either a rude response or they just tell me to go to help desk.  If you don’t have to deal with gate agents thing run smoothly but again I hate dealing with their gate agents.",2
AZM,Typical tourist trap. Also the air smelt musty and stale,2
Museum,Did not like this wax museum.  The wax figures didn't look as life-like as wax museum.  We walked the entire museum in 20 minutes.,2
Attraction,"Fun but wouldn’t come again
Wide open due to bad weather. Probably wouldn’t recommend if crowded and had to wait for the same rides.",2
Zoo,"This is based on our Last visit. The bathroom were filthy with TP all over the floor, missing TP to use and no paper towels to dry the hands. The water to wash hands were in what could be illegally low cold. Aside for that, the staff is super sweet and helpful.",2
AZM,Our first time visiting and we sadly think it was not worth the price. There really wasn’t much to do & very minimal animals.,2
Airport,"One of the biggest, most disorganized, airports in the North America.
Get ready to walk 5 miles and pay $20 for old food that inst even correct.",2
Museum,"Spent more time in line trying to reserve a seat on a tram visit (because the app was down) then experiencing the museum itself.Unaware that the tram tours were outdoors.  As it was a bit chilly outside, that didn't allow for the best experience when not having proper attire.",2
AZM,(Translated by Google) The price for foreigners is expensive. I didn&#39;t get the feeling that it was big compared to the expensive ones. (Original) The price for foreigners is expensive. I didn&#39;t get the feeling that it was big compared to the expensive ones.,2
Airport,"Bathroom stalls near Gate B do not have hooks or shelves to hold a bag. They look like they were once there, and not replaced.",2
AZM,A lot of exhibits not working which was disappointing. Plus more disinfecting should be taking place.,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) I wonder if there are not many places to play because it is small for the price. It is subtle that infants are also required to wear masks.,2
AZM,Pricey and too short. Not enough to see/do. Worth if you buy the 5'ver but not as a single purchase.,2
Museum,This place has went down hill since the last time I visited 6 years ago. Half of the games and interactive stuff doesn’t work. Staff was even telling us of other places that was more fun than there. Do better wonderworks! I use to love your upside down museum!,2
Airport,"Long walks from the terminal to the main entrance, should have more people movers or a tram. I don't favor flying in here, next time I'm going to try JKF",2
Museum,Not really worth the money but it's not a bad activity to do.,2
Theme Park,Way to crowded and charged full price when 25% of the park was closed,2
Theme Park,Top dollar attraction. Pretty  run down in spots. Merch is of poor quality. Lego sets overpriced.,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) smaller than Lotte I went to Lotte because I was tired of it... (Original) I went once because I was tired of Lotte...,2
Airport,Not enough signs as you are coming in to the airport. Especially for rental car returns,2
Aquarium,Very expensive for what we've got for adult- valued entertainment.,2
Theme Park,"We got there at opening, but rides didn't open for another hour. Most rides were shut down for the day.",2
Theme Park,Would have been better if the souvenir shop wasn't the only thing open.  The Skyview shut down due to winds a half hour before we got in the park and the guy at the gate had told us that it was running.  It was still good to see a historical art before people decide it needs to be erased.,2
Theme Park,The park itself is beautiful but it's been turned into this nightmare money grabbing capitalist hellscape. If you're gonna go plan to spend big money because they will try and squeeze you for everything you've got.,2
Airport,There really need to more signs to identify the relocated cell phone,2
Zoo,November or December 2022 large animals attacked the Seattle Aerial Dance troupe,2
Aquarium,Ripoff price for almost $50 entry fee on top of paid parking smh,2
Airport,Large airport. Lots of restaurants. The busiest airport the country. But no electrical outlets work while waiting at Delta Gates on Terminal D. That’s pretty ridiculous. Why even have them?,2
AZM,Long long long line to purchase tickets. Only one cashier open. About 8 minutes for one party to decide what to putchase.,2
AZM,Great Zoo but extremely overpriced. Unfortunate that there are a lot of families unable to attend due to price gouging,2
Airport,1: There was no cart in the luggage delivery area and I waited an hour for them to bring a cart,2
Aquarium,"Eh it was ok. Nothing special. Most exhibits were either closed or roped off. Tons of people, but no one to ask for help on how to find certain animals. Wouldn't go back. For the price of it I'd rather go to Minnesota or Denver.",2
Airport,First time I had my disinfectant spray (3oz spray bottle) thrown away🤯🤯🤯 never happened before especially during an pandemic. TSA be doing too much🙄😩,2
Aquarium,Not worth the money. Stretched out my visit to 35 minutes.,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) It is an experience more for small children. No variety for teens (Original) It is one more experience for young children. No variety for teens,2
Theme Park,"Restaurants really need attention, staff not friendly, food ⭐⭐⭐",2
Aquarium,"Not worth our time and money
The aquarium is mostly suited to families with young children. It wasn’t a good value for adults. $70+ a waste of money for us.",2
Aquarium,"Parking Problem
Could not get into the large parking garage for the aquarium because the ticket vending machine was broken.  The call button did not help.  Parking on the street is hard.",2
Aquarium,"Aura migraine inducing.
It is hard to find fault with any organization that does so much for wildlife. However, the combination of the lighting and the curvature of the large tank instantly gave me an aura migraine. This made it difficult to really enjoy anything after that.",2
Aquarium,Not at all impressed! Price was way too high for the limited amount of entertainment. Would be great if price was about 1/4 of what it is.,2
Aquarium,"Kinda small for how much I paid for my family, done in an hour. it was ok for being not close to the ocean. Petting zoo of sea creatures sounds cool, feel sorry for them, they don't get pet in there natural habitat. Small cage for penguins. Not very impressed.",2
Aquarium,"Very very small aquarium. The ""turtle hospital"" was very cool. Thought ticket prices were a bit expensive but I don't complain if I know it's going to a good cause! But probably wouldn't return.",2
Aquarium,"I had a hard time trusting this place, it seemed pretty fishy.",2
Airport,"Too big line up for security checks, pretty much every one is not happy how it takes very long time, moving very very slow,
Also a room for improvement is infrastructure with charging ports
People scramble to charge their phones",2
Airport,This airport needs an expansion and an upgrade. No way this is the second biggest city in Texas and the airport looks like this,2
Airport,"The general public restrooms are disgusting. It smells like an outhouse, and there is such a strong chlorine smell from the sinks. I'm glad I have lounge access, at least.",2
AZM,"OSHA needs to check this place out!
Other locations are much better than this one on proper safety measures.
Report to OSHA. Ride at your own risk, little kids should NOT be on these rides for sure. Larger rides are simply not safe/up to code.

GM responsible for this location: Adam",2
Airport,"Where ATL located ride-sharing is a complete joke. And, I can't remember the last time the gate was available when the pledge landed. Broken down plane in the gate with no tow...",2
Airport,Where rideshare is located is a complete joke. Can't remember the last time the gate was available when the plane landed here. Took over one hour to get out of this airport after the plane landed.,2
Airport,"Disorienting signage, great people watching.🤣",2
Airport,The security line was to long which took up at least 35 minutes. This should be improved for travellers to have some time to relax before taking flights .,2
Airport,"Terrible experience. While arriving, the baggage came on 2 belts which was confusing and took almost an hour for our bags to arrive. There is a free shuttle that takes you to the main (domestic) airport and is around 15 minutes ride and Marta station is there and or domestic connections . It is rather frustrating after landing from a 15 hour international flight.",2
Airport,"Massive! Expensive, not many sit down restraints, at lease in the d concourse. I’d take a decade to explore this whole place.",2
Airport,Pretty much the usual.  Busy...dirty... the rudest employees you might find anywhere. I give it 2 stars just because I have to go through it when I can't get around it...it's a good thing Delta has better fares. I don't say this often but wow...avoid it,2
Airport,Definitely not the most efficient     Osaka and many others beat it by a mile.  Southern hospitality is verrrry slow,2
Airport,There is only one restaurant in the terminal before you go through security.,2
Airport,Need better transportation for people with disabilities,2
Aquarium,The food court was expensive and the floors were sticky,2
Museum,"I was very pleased to receive a hospitality discount for my girlfriend and me; however, many attractions inside were out of order or malfunctioning.",2
Airport,"Not my favorite airport, always extremely long wait lines in security and parking is rough. I did enjoy the coffee and tea place in terminal B today though",2
Aquarium,"Like a giant, puffed up bag of chips. So much empty space, so few fish. Took an hour to explore for $50 per person. Definitely NOT worth it.",2
Aquarium,(Translated by Google) Very small and not so much variety (Original),2
Airport,To get to the shuttle area for the hotels is very confusing,2
Aquarium,"Highly disappointed. We enjoyed the Gatlinburg Tennessee aquarium more that this, along with the Chattanooga aquarium. Other ones have vibrant colors of the sea... it was dull. And very small, inadequate.",2
Museum,"Skip if you have been to the Air &Space museum in DC or Cape Kennedy
If you have been to the Smithsonian or Cape Kennedy, skip this.  You have already seem it all. If not, it's interesting. There nothing new that you haven't  seen.",2
Airport,Doesn't seem well managed or well staffed. Long lines at TSA during normally low traffic periods. Lack of concern for travelers. TSA is just rude to passengers.,2
Museum,"(Translated by Google) For children - go. For adults - complete boredom. If you don&#39;t live in Chicago, it will be more expensive (Original) For adults - complete boredom. If you don&#39;t live in Chicago, it will be more expensive",2
AZM,Most places didn’t even have the animals in it to see them and there was only one restaurant cafe thing that was way too pricey and wasn’t even that good. Kinda disappointing really.,2
Airport,Slow. 3 hours to get out of the airport,2
Aquarium,Guided tour was rushed....kids didn't have time to view any exhibits not on the guided tour.,2
Aquarium,"Not at big as you would think, I also have the year pass and they are unable to use my 20% parking discount that comes with it, a lot of exhibits are currently closed, always busy and crowded.",2
AZM,(Translated by Google) Petersburg is better (Original),2
Aquarium,"Too crowded on weekend (Saturday) morning. It is not large as I image, I visited S.E.A aquarium in Singapore 2 times, it is larger than here.
Cafeteria also crowded, price is high, taste is so so.",2
Theme Park,(Translated by Google) Beautiful park but charging $20 entrance and then asking even more for the cable car or the historic village is absurd. (Original) Beautiful park but charging $ 20 entrance and then asking even more for the cable car or the historic village is absurd.,2
Airport,Arrivals was a mess.  No enforcement of parking prohibited.,2
Airport,Who closes bathrooms to clean 15 minutes before the gate right by it starts boarding,2
Zoo,(Translated by Google) I think they need more. Little Animals has 1 or 2 nomas of each species and a lot of space with nothing. My kids got bored fast (Original) I think they need more. Little Animals has 1 or 2 nomas of each species and a lot of space with nothing. My kids got bored fast,2

Theme Park,The kids had a blast however our whole party of 9 ended up with food poisoning from the hotdogs and lost a day of our vacation due to this,2
Aquarium,It was disappointing to have an whole exhibit closed with no signs. All my granddaughter talked about is seeing the gators and we saved it for the end and it ended in disappointment,2
AZM,"Honestly it wasn’t as expected, there are sections that doesn’t make sense to be part of Madame Tussauds, overpriced too.",2
AZM,Very disappointing. Magic show was weak and food was lousy. The only positive was the service was good. There must be much better options for the Orlando area.,2
Aquarium,"Parking was horrible! Bring an additional 40$ just in case their lot is full, or just buy a parking ticket online(IF AVAILABLE). This place is not good for last-minute trips and if it is crowded just reschedule or request a refund it's not worth it for the tickets plus the additional 40$ to park.",2
Aquarium,"(Translated by Google) Not much to see, so the price is a bit ambiguous (Original)",2
Theme Park,Took an hour in line just to park today and paid $25 on top of the $85 per person entrance fee. Two of the entrance lanes were not open. Please get better.,2
Aquarium,(Translated by Google) An aquarium that is gradually falling into disrepair (Original),2
Zoo,Worst food selection and service I've ever got hardly any decent food for the prices also your people shouldn't yell at the customers while they're looking at the menus trying to figure out what they want. Plus like 60% the entire zoo is closed for remodeling save your money.,2
Attraction,"Park hours
With these wait times the park needs to open earlier and stay open later than 5-6pm. Plus most snack stands were closed for a busy holiday weekend.",2
Aquarium,"Aquarium seemed nice. But, it was hard to enjoy it when we were shoulder to shoulder with people the whole time. Letting that many people in... was ridiculous and completely ruined our visit. I've enjoyed other aquariums waaaay more.",2
Museum,Made the mistake of going for President's day (free day). It was extremely hot AND way too crowded!! Not enjoyable at all. The temperature was up way too high (I was only wearing a sweater). I would recommend going on regular week day.,2
Aquarium,"Crowded, no personnel at entrances anymore you just self scan 😕 not many staff around to help crowd control or answer questions",2
AZM,"Many exhibitions were closed
The a/c was not strong enough
Too expensive I paid 158 for 3 adults and 1 kid “ for all acces”",2
Airport,Free WiFi is a myth.. 🎈 Please wait till your connection is established. How long? 1 day 🎈,2
Airport,"Unusually bad tonight. Customs took 2 hours at International Terminal. Traffic is backed up at both North and South Terminals. Give yourself 3 hours coming or going out of ATL tonight, Tuesday, February 21, 2023.",2
Aquarium,"Too many people, no limits on the number of people in specific areas.",2
Theme Park,"there are absolutely no rides for bigger people, and furthermore just to be able to go in and shop or be there with your kids is still full price to not be able to do anything.  will definitely not be going back",2
Airport,"Too crowded, even more than usually if it is possible",2
Airport,This was my first time here. I dropped off a friend and then picked him up a couple days later. I was kind of let down by my experience picking him up .  There was no place to park and wait for him .  If you don't know your way around  it can be very confusing trying to find terminals.,2
Airport,"Concourse B smelled like a porta potty

Too many people, gates too far apart",2
Aquarium,It was busy so many of the exhibits were had to see,2
Airport,Disappointed in the overflowing trash cans.,2
Theme Park,"Monster Money Grab
This is nothing short of a MONSTER MONEY GRAB. So disappointing in many ways with the worst being no difference in admission fees if you are two, twelve, twenty or eighty. Once you get inside, the excessive prices continue. Shame on the leadership of this place.",2
Attraction,I seriously hate how late it opens as someone who drove from Arizona so I'm already an hour ahead. The place doesn't open till 10am which is basically 11am for me and that's nap time. For a theme park designed for children they really didn't have them in mind when scheduling their hours.,2
Aquarium,Marine life was great.  Confused why they let Jimmy buffet resorts sales people way lay you trying to sell vacation packages.   We were really just trying to see the aquarium.   Segregated Confusing.   Parking horrible.   Not friendly.,2
Airport,Not great this time.  I was picking people up and they waited on the plane for more than 30 mins because there was a plane at their gate.   No place to wait either.  Cars stopped on the side of the roads everywhere.  Seems like very poor planning.,2

AZM,It starts with Bollywood celebrities and it's very poor work.,2
Airport,"All I have to say is this airport gave me the motivation to get global entry. When coming back into the u.s. from an international trip the wait is unbearable, especially because this airport is extremely hot, little to no ventilation and try and put cats and herding into a sentence lol. Busy busy place but the staff are pleasant at least.",2
Airport,We were lucky and didn't have our flight canceled but upon arrival at almost midnight we had to wait 2-3 hours to get our luggage because there was only ONE crew unloading baggage from ALL of the flights. Was this a Delta issue or a JFK issue? Well at 2:30 AM I just wanted to go home!!,2
Airport,"So glad I don't live in NYC because this airport is horrid. Not as bad as LaGuardia but Jesus. Lacking signage, VERY rude employees. Literally yelled at me to move lines because one of the lines was for employees; why not put up a sign indicating that?genius thought, I know. Only thing that made it good was the bartender at the Mexican place who was super friendly.",2
Airport,"For being JFK airport and the international terminal - it's disappointing. Not a variety of food selection. Mostly Shake Shacks. Mac Donald's of course a d few others. Only decent place is ""Bento Box"".",2
Museum,"If you don't book the tours in advance, it's likely you don't get a place for both, and the entrance is only worth your money if you actually take both tours, I wish it was like before where you could simply board the bus and visit both areas  one after the other",2
AZM,It was super busy. Don't know what was going on  had to park at the overflow area,2
Museum,NOTICE if you weigh 250 + pounds don't expect to ride or enjoy the majority of the activities here. Also must have tons of patience to wait in never-ending lines. I will say that the exhibits are filled with interesting information. $66 for 1 adult and 1 child.,2
Airport,"TSA was fast at 0500, Small, Crowded, not too many food choices. No Airlines clubs...",2
Airport,"Not an efficient airport for shuttle-like traffic. Took an hour to reach my gate from the front door. The flight was 1:18, but the overall experience took well over 4 hours.",2
Airport,Overpriced and bad food; all the beauty of a DMV.,2
Airport,Not my favorite airport to layover.  Not many healthy food choices. Most places close early. No good lounges and no gym or minute suites. Bathrooms are clean at least.,2
Airport,"Today I am going to miss my connection as BDL is taking 90 minutes wait time to deice planes. Really unacceptable timing, the airport didn't plan enough crews to handle a small 4 inch snow storm? The storm was forecast a week ago so there's no excuse for not being prepared, plenty of time to prepare.",2
AZM,(Translated by Google) Very small for this high price (Original) Very small for this high price,2
AZM,Been to zoo across the globe but this one is Not worth the $$. Rides weren’t smooth. The Africa exhibit could have been bigger and no lions. Disappointed overall.,2
Airport,It really could use some modernization.,2
Attraction,Worst site to buy tickets they make it so complicated to purchase 2 simple tickets. Website has to much going on. Won’t connect to checkout won’t let you take tickets off you have to cancel the whole purchase to take one ticket off. Ridiculous,2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Expensive, not worth it. Even in Vladivostok, the oceanarium is cooler (Original) Expensive, not worth it. Even in Vladivostok, the oceanarium is cooler",2
Theme Park,Bring back the sorghum making display. I want to see old timey displays such as this which is good for all ages of people.,2
Museum,"Way over priced. 60$ for two people. Plus tac on 15$ a person to go to mission control. Wow. That's sad. I remember enjoying this place as a kid. Today, seemed no attractions were working. I'm just not sure why it cost so much.?.  Then they try to charge you again to see the good stuff.",2
Aquarium,Need to be more organized with direction on where to go next...place was packed it was a mess,2
Theme Park,Completely overrated. $120+ for a ticket for a 2 year old! No difference in prices for tickets. Lines 45-60 minutes long for rides plus rides are limited due to height restrictions. Better off taking the kids to a Lego movie and then to the beach.,2
Airport,seriously.  worlds most efficient airport?,2
Airport,Followed signs to baggage claim only to find out it was not the right place. No good way of finding shuttle service back to my motel.,2
Airport,"Customer service needs improvement. However, I understand why the staff isn't very happy. They have to wear several layers of clothes for a uniform, and it gets hot. TSA staff acts like we're stupid and just a pain in their butt.",2
Airport,"Unfortunately, I was departing from gate T3, and most of the restaurants and shops in this terminal were closed by 6:30 pm when my arriving flight landed.  I checked the website and many stated they would be open later than the time that it was. I walked the entire terminal and was disappointed in the places that were open.  It was a long 3.5 hour layover in Atlanta today.",2
Airport,How good can the hell that is ATL be?😆,2
Aquarium,Membership Cree Maddie and rooster should be fired foe incompetence,2
Airport,Floor isn’t comfortable enough,2
Garden,"We did not enjoy it. The outdoors looked like wasteland during our visit in March. The indoors greenhouses were really not that interesting. The art gallery was sort of all right, but too small. If you have been to a nice botanical garden before in your life, you may be disappointed.",2
Airport,"Construction … ugh. I haven’t been here in 15 years, and don’t miss it.",2
Aquarium,"It's hard to have a great experience with thousands of other people swarming around especially when you have a toddler with a stroller. I went on a Monday to avoid the crowds of the weekend, but apparently, there are hoards of people everyday.",2
Airport,"I saw an accident happen there, after 30 mins still no officer showed up.",2
Airport,"The men's bathroom was too small on the C Concourse.  There were only 3 urinals, and 1 of the urinals wasn't working.",2
Airport,All ways very busy sometimes it's hard to get help with wheelchairs.people are treated like cattle .,2
Aquarium,"Kids wilder than sharks
Our visit was completely ruined by several school classes with uncontrolled screaming kids.Don’t go there during school days.",2
Museum,"Not impressed
Very few of the waxworks here look much like the people they are supposed to be. Some were identifiable by their clothing. Others, neither my wife nor I could identify. Even the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were unconvincing and they are not real people.",2
Airport,"My daughter and my son tried to fly out of Bradley on Friday March 3rd and because she miss placed her photo ID they wouldn’t let her fly. She had her birth certificate, SS card, military ID and her Nurses license. I don’t know what else she needed",2
Theme Park,I miss the Lazer show and didn't really like the drone show,2
Zoo,"There are better zoos
This is a really small zoo and most of the animals weren't even there. We pretty much just watched the seals swim back and forth. A little too expensive for the animals to be missing.",2
Museum,"UNDER 12 yrs old good😀
This was NOT worth the money. We paid 121.00 bucks for 4 tickets with coupons. We were done in 45 min or less. Very disappointed. We definitely won’t be back. I think if you have kids 12 and under they will love it. The guy at the desk was super nice. 3-8-23",2
Museum,Disappointing for the price and how busy it is.  Field trips should be held on specific days so it doesn't interfere with the number of families that go.  Too many people waiting for each activity.,2
Museum,"3-8-23
I think if you have kids 12 and under they would love this place. 4 of us went and the price was 121.00 with coupons and we were done by 45 min or under. Too much. Wasn’t worth it. The guy behind the desk was super nice. We truly wished we spent that kind of money elsewhere. 😕",2
Airport,Busy of course. Difficult to get from one end to another if flights are delayed,2
Aquarium,Some para where close due to lack of staff… or they close early; it was a Friday and I will think they had things plan but it wasn’t the case,2
Aquarium,All the “touch tanks were empty”. The kids got to touch water only. Don’t stop at the cafeteria. A water bottle was $6.,2
Museum,Sadly the guided tour for the day was overbooked and we were left disappointed not to get a chance to visit inside. Just clicked some pics from outside and left. I recommend to book tickets in advance even if you are visiting on weekdays.,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) Not worth the money. Not maintained well enough (Original) not worth the money. Not maintained well enough,2
Airport,The walk to baggage claim is long way away.,2
Museum,"Honestly my fault for going to a tourist trap, but I needed to kill time before a restaurant opened.",2
Aquarium,They don’t support teachers! The NJEA gave a promo code and price and the aquarium would not honor the price.,2
Museum,"Expected a lot more for the price; we had 2 adults and 1 child, for which we paid $94; just didn't think it was worth the price for a 20-min tour around the building; I would go elsewhere.",2
Museum,"Really expensive, huge lines at every exhibit. Essentially paid a lot of money to wait in line. Don't waste your $",2
Museum,This place would be great if half the things weren't broke or more employees.  Spent over $65 for 7 hours of like 3 things. Not managed very well.exanple 1 not working.,2
Aquarium,Horrible traffic management even for prepaid parking (22 minutes to get in a space in the parking garage). Dirty viewing areas. Hard to find employees for directions. The aquatic life was friendly.,2
Airport,Arrived 35 minutes early on Frontier airlines and have been sitting on the tarmac because they supposedly have no open gate. Hard to believe at 9 pm they can’t handle this on a timely manner. Now 34 minutes and no news when a gate will open up . Incompetent?,2
Airport,This airport sucks. It's huge and there is no moving sidewalks. Everything is so far away from each other so plan on doing too much walking. They do have a decent cafeteria but all that walking is too much,2
AZM,They significantly jacked up the prices and it is not as good as it use to be.,2
Aquarium,"Do not come here when the kids are on break. Extremely crowded. Sold out shows. There should be a capacity limit. It's hard to enjoy the aquarium when you can barely move.
I can't give a fair review on the exhibits because I could barely see them.",2
Aquarium,Visited on a Sunday and Tuesday with both days equally crowded.  Makes for a difficult experience with small children since they're not able to see over the crowds and  more time is spent navigating crowds.,2
Airport,Electronic maps not updated. Food services still listed but gone. Corner bakery in T terminal for one.,2
Museum,For the price it is not worth it! Didn’t find it to be very entertaining and the exhibits are not very out together. After visiting natural history museum in NYC this is a huge disappointment and waste of money.,2
Airport,"What I've noticed about Atlanta is they believe that no one desires a cup of coffee after 11AM. Other than that, it's an airport in the United States.",2
Aquarium,The only downside is it can get pretty packed on the weekends,2
Aquarium,"Awful use of $200! Way, way too crowded and loud to enjoy anything. My whole family and I left with a headache.",2
Theme Park,Not their fault but hour and a half wait+ just to get in. Nightmare traffic on spring break,2
Theme Park,If you don't spend the $80 a day extra per person for the Time Saver you will spend the entire day to ride four or five rides if you're lucky. It's getting worse than Disney...,2
Theme Park,"Surprise confederate monument, in case that kind of thing doesn’t appeal to you.",2
Theme Park,"Had to stand in line for 45 minutes min. To get anything, including something to drink",2
Aquarium,"It was very crowded when I visited there. During the busy time, some of the on site staff members just stood there and chatted with each other without doing anything to maintain the order.",2
AZM,"Meh
We've been to some much better zoos. Tickets are very pricey for what you get. Yes, you'll see lots of animals but nothing spectacular.",2
Airport,International Baggage claim was not a good experience!,2
Airport,"Too busy, waited hours to get into a lounge. And they said they could only let us in 1 hour before our departure, when we had a 6 hour layover.",2
Museum,"We enjoyed the Center. Won't return though, $93 for 2 adults and 3 kids. $310 for year pass. I'll choose the zoo instead.",2
Theme Park,"Avoid Spring Break in March
I haven't been to Dollywood in about 8 years. It was spring break and ridiculously crowded. We bought season passes and went for 2 days. The lines were insane. I wish we would have gone another time. I felt like we were at Disney.",2
Airport,"Flight was great, but then had to wait over an hour at luggage carousel for our luggage. Then when we get our luggage it was soaking wet. That is not acceptable, but there is no other airport in the Atlanta area so I guess you get what you get and you don't pitch a fit.",2
Theme Park,Nice place. Clean. Very confusing to navigate even with a map.,2
Aquarium,(Translated by Google) no whales 1 hour and a half viewing time (Original) No whales. About 1 hour and a half viewing time,2
Airport,"Never fails, bags always take 30+ minutes minimum to come out.",2
AZM,(Translated by Google) Admission covered Only a few animals that you cannot see in any other zoo (Original) Admission covered Only a few animals that you cannot see in any other zoo,2
Theme Park,So commercialized now! They took away all of Dolly's things and replaced it with roller coasters. So sad and not worth the money for people who don't ride any roller coasters like my young children. 😕,2
Theme Park,Price was too much for what it was. We found the exit in less than 5 minutes but went back to the beginning a few times and played hide & seek to try and get money's worth. Should be $9.99 for adults & $4.99 for kids.,2
Theme Park,They just don’t keep it up very good and with the price increases it’s not the value it once was. The new boat ride is a joke and already only partially working,2
Theme Park,They need to raise the cleanliness and train the staff to be nice and not rushed,2
Theme Park,I was very excited to come revisit the park but due to getting stuck on the technic coaster and getting kicked off Flight school twice for unknown ride delays I'm upset and feel like I wasted my money. The Lego Factory has a poor selection of bricks with dozens of spots containing duplicate peices,2
Attraction,"Very cute theme park designed for younger (10 and under) children. The experience itself was poor, though. Very poor crowd management. We waited 45-60 for a meal. Ride waits were long for a less busy day. And several rides were down which funneled the guests. Not impressed.",2
Museum,"Half the things you can do have error messages, definitely not worth the money you pay for it. We made the best of it but it needs work.",2
Theme Park,Park is not aging well a lot of rust and dirt/mildew on rides. All day drink is a joke when you can't find your drink at any of the freestyles even after hours of advising staff it was out on all machines. Rides break often as well.,2
Museum,I gave it two stars because everything but Expedition Health is five stars because most stuff in expedition health doesn't work. Also most of the buttons in the museum don't work.,2
Museum,"Definitely not on the same level as Florida. NOT worth the admission price charged. Staff did not alert anyone to tours selling out, or that one is more sought after than the other. We literally spent our time walking around the exhibit hall and shopping. Book WAY AHEAD or be disappointed.",2
Museum,Money factory. All is good to make money again...Bad experience because the shuttles were closed on afternoon.,2
AZM,Neet to see but way overcrowded. Extremely limited to see the magic show. Long line to get in. Some stuff not working inside.,2
Zoo,"Hard to get around too all the exhibit with the way its set up and with the remodeling which I understand why, just hard with little kids",2
Theme Park,"Disappointing Visit to Silver Dollar City
We have been to Silver Dollar City twice.  Once during the Christmas Season and it was so cold only 2 rides were running for our Grandkids to enjoy and the second time was summertime in which a storm blew in and closed the Park.",2
Museum,"(Translated by Google) The interior space is very small, very few spatial things (Original) The interior space is very small, very few spatial things",2
AZM,(Translated by Google) Why can&#39;t I get cash??????😡😡😡 (Original) Why can&#39;t I get cash??????😡😡😡,2
AZM,As usual half price for locals and full price for Asean poor countries...not fair at all and cashier rather agressive. Numbers of exhibitions or attractions not functioning but additional charges always proposed. Nice overall but overcharged and nothing really exceptional. Kind of tourists trap...,2
Aquarium,For 30 dollars I would have like to sea more sea animals,2
Aquarium,"Focused on plastic pollution and other oceans problems, which is good to show us all, but there is nothing else to see than it.",2
Aquarium,Not much of an aquarium beings how it right on the ocean.,2
Aquarium,It wasn't worth the $35 dollar admission price. Needs more exhibits.,2
Aquarium,"Not a great aquarium. Pretty small and boring for the price. Also you have to pay on your phone and then scan the barcode. Pretty ridiculous.

The eagle enclosure is especially depressing. You can touch sea stars, sting rays, and sharks. But not worth the money.",2
Aquarium,To small for the cost. A family of four well over $130 and done in an hour and a half. Underwhelming experience for kids over 6. Pack a lunch or eat prior. Just a small overpriced snack stand.,2
Aquarium,Very over priced $36 USD per person.  Takes about an hour or two to walk through.,2
Aquarium,I was not impressed with this medium-sized aquarium. Not worth $40 for adults or teens. May be better for families with small children. The sea turtle rehab was the only really interesting exhibit.,2
AZM,"Honestly, this place was very overpriced.  It is a very small aquarium that costs $35.99+ per person.  I understand that Branson is a tourist town but it shouldn’t be that expensive.  It’s no where near as big as the Shed Aquarium in Chicago where you can get tickets for $37.95+.",2
Garden,Currently March 21st the elevator in the green vivarium is out of service,2
Theme Park,The carving is so dirty and eroded that you can barely see it. Going to the top of the rock is fun,2
Attraction,"Sad trip
Lots of rides not working or would break down. Very disappointing trip.  Legoland needs to step up its game. Long lines for anything running.",2
Museum,It was way too crowded. Several things were not functional or overbooked. We ended up walking around and left.,2
Airport,"Very busy.
Hate the golf carts!",2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Nothing to see for the price It is said to be the largest in East Asia, but I do not know which part is the largest (Original)",2
Aquarium,"The price of 47 cad + taxes, long slow line at the entrance even on a work-day, only 1 person serving the queue made me skip this place and after reading other reviews I think it’s a smart decision.",2
AZM,Half of the activities were down so it wasn't worth our time or money. The one in Pigeon Forge was great so we were looking forward to this activity during our beach stay. Hopefully they got things up and running for the next visitors.,2
Museum,They need more interactive exhibitions other than VR,2
Airport,"First they sent our plane to an occupied gate. After sitting on the plane for 20 minutes waiting for a solution, we were assigned a new gate. We went to the new gate. Then we sat on the plane for another 15 minutes waiting for the ground crew to arrive due to the “last minute change.” Now I’ll be running to my connection. Seems like this was an avoidable mistake by someone.",2
Aquarium,This place is way over crowded. You buy your tickets with an appointment time and still aren't able to see all the exhibits. This is the worst aquarium that I have ever visited.,2
Airport,Ac needs some work and reptacles for charging g don’t work,2
Theme Park,"Staff was rude
Went to legoland in Illinois about 9 years ago and it was amazing so figured while we were at Disney we’d go to legoland in Orlando. Well it was nothing like last time. Staff were rude and kids did not have an amazing time like last time.",2
Theme Park,It was crowded the rides sucked and the pass was expensive and it just was blah... I do not recommend. There is nothing really to say about it expect I wish I hadn't gone. I would rather have believed it was as great as I once thought.,2
Museum,"Very expensive for a short, self-guided tour. If you're only doing the wax museum, the price of admission is not worth it. You will have to get the other parts of the all-access pass to make it worth the price of admission.",2
Aquarium,"Need t able to visit all the tickets sold out hours add online,  very disappointed",2
Airport,Didn't help with my handicap husband. Either the Destin or Hartsfield-Jackson Airport loading crew damaged my husband's brand new scooter that cost over $5000! All our flights were delayed. Overall hours spent waiting at the airports were 13 hrs,2
Museum,(Translated by Google) I think the only thing worth seeing is the rocket. Don&#39;t spend money on the simulators (Original) I think the only thing worth seeing is the rocket. Don&#39;t spend money on the simulators,2
Airport,"It's hot inside here, well Concourse D is.",2
AZM,"The service was very good they brought out the pizza, drinks, and dessert very quickly. The magic in the show was not so magical. Each magic trick seemed very long & drawn out.",2
Airport,Everyone that works there is disgruntled,2
Airport,Not sure how I feel about people roller skating in the concourses? Seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen! It does however let me know that Airport security is not concerned! Atlanta seems to have a broken give a damn meter these days.,2
Theme Park,"Save your money, this was very expensive $10 for kids and adults $13. Might be good for little kids 6 and below. It made my daughter and myself kind of queasy. Husband says it was a rip off.",2
Airport,Arggg flew into airport.. and wasnt able to get wifi connection to get an uber or lyft..no 5G no nothing..took a taxi....7 miles = 70 dlls beware,2
AZM,(Translated by Google) It was a theme park that I thought it would be better if the adult price was cheaper because it was a children&#39;s main park! It was a theme park as much as I thought!,2
Theme Park,"Very short maze. Clean environment, though, but overall a waste of money. We were in the maze less than ten minutes before the children had solved it.",2
Attraction,"1st and last
Its expensive.  So you would expect nice warm food and better customer service.  The lines last longer then the rides . If Lego land offered money back id sooo ask for it .",2
Airport,Concourse D is too tight and crowded. Needs to be widened like the other concourses.,2
Garden,"Tried to visit on Sunday. With storms in the area, we tried to contact the facility by phone and via email.  Got no response.  Drive one hour to get there only to find that the facility was closed due to the storms which flooded some of the roads in the garden area.",2
Aquarium,I’m pretty sure cash is still legal tender issued by the federal government.  The aquarium doesn’t appear to agree and will not take cash.  Lame.,2
Airport,Really crowded and dirty bathrooms,2
Aquarium,"I think that the price is a bit much. But, what do I know. I've heard that you need a loan just to get into Disney with your family.🥴",2
AZM,"(Translated by Google) Bruce Lee didn&#39;t look like him lol Princess Diana was tall Is it ok if I go once? It was Sunday, but it was empty. It was a Sunday, but it was empty.",2
Airport,Slept here because of missed connection. The homeless steal baggage out of the carousel and then sleep in the second floor above the Burger King with the baggage to look like passengers.,2
Garden,Unfortunately the recent storm took out all the blossoms which was the specific reason we came here.  They could have let us know when we callled and asked about the gardens.,2
Airport,"I would expect an airport of this size to move bodies through TSA check-in a bit faster.  Great city, slow airport",2
Museum,"The content is good, but a lot of the staff act very rude and entitled leaving a sour taste in the mouth after the experience. The amount of snotty remarks that were received by staff here is unprecedented and inappropriate in the workplace.",2
Airport,Seemed kind of dirty in some areas.,2
Theme Park,I guess we should just all be okay with this discussing gas station food for $13 because it's Legoland right?,2
Theme Park,"Not good
We are unsure how and why Dollywood is advertised as the most popular amusement park in America.  The roller coasters were either not working, really old, and/or super short.  The one exception is the Flying Eagle.  As a family with teens, we suggest spending your day and money elsewhere.",2
Airport,Parking was horrible....I got there at 5:00 pm.... It took me until 6 to find a parking spot...good thing my flight didnt leave until 10:00 pm...,2
Airport,"Airport workers are rude for starters. Airport is also too big especially from the time you exit the plane till you make it to baggage claim. If you’re into stealing luggage this place is perfect because it’s a two mile walk then another mile on the train then another mile walk to baggage claim. Overall,this place makes me appreciate Fred Shuttleworth International Airport even more",2
Attraction,need a review of ride procedure. Also need to hire full staff- One person per some rides is not enough- just makes for long lines,2
Aquarium,"Very very expensive for what you get especially if you buy tickets on the same day. It cost us $96 for 2 adults and it barely takes an hour to get through. Not worth the price, unfortunately.",2
AZM,Many of the exhibits are broken and it was overcrowded even on a slow week.  Several exhibits had long lines.  Very expensive for what you get.  My kids were ready to leave after an hour.,2
Aquarium,"The aquarium is mainly fillers & etc facts to read about. There are not alot of live animals.  We were very disappointed.  The Baltimore Aquarium is much better! Also,the parking garage is horrible.",2
AZM,Definitely could have used more attractions *aquariums* I feel there were some missed opportunities for some cool tanks. It took us about 1 hr to go through the whole thing with 4 kids. The kids had a blast though and loved the touch tanks and the 5D ride.,2
Zoo,"I had great memories of this Zoo but this visit was not worth the drive. Very few animals. Really it just seemed sad. We saw the red wolves, seals, otters, tapir, muskox,1 tiger and 1 elephant and the Pacific Aquarium.",2
Aquarium,It was expensive even with a 15% off coupon it cost $98 for three of us to go. It was smaller than we're used to as well. We did love the octopus and the river exhibit.,2
Airport,"Calls itself the ""Busiest, and most efficient airport in the world"" over the PA constantly, yet has NO self service passport checks, so you have to stand in a 2 hour line everytime you come in from an international flight....  Hmmm....",2
Museum,"It’s not worth all the money. It’s too expensive. If you’re a person who prefers usual science exhibits (like me), this isn’t the place for you. However, if you prefer “edutainment” then it’s for you. It depends on what you prefer.",2
